            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe Subject I am upon was never more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſeaſonable then in theſe unhappy times wherein we live, where we finde men generally ſo vicious that vertue is almoſt extirpate, and not a few become ſo monſtrouſly bruitiſh, that no philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy can ſweeten and allay their extream bitterneſſe, and ſo flinty are their tempers, that love, that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and delicate plant, can have no rooting among them; but that which is moſt to be lamented is, that perſons of a ſofter mould, and pliant, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough to love and friendſhip, are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled by other objects, and ſo averted, that they do not think it worth their while to ſtudy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themſelves with this great affair: if any thing I have done could be ſo ſucceſsful as to prevail with them to conſult the reaſon, conveniency, and excellency of this great concern, and weigh things in the ballance of right reaſon; I dare ſay the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance would incline another way then it doth with them now: I do not fear that any perſon though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo envious ſhould upon the firſt glance of this book take upon him to prejudge it, but rather expect the Title Page ſhould prove a powerful motive to induce and incline the Reader to a further ſearch into the nature of that ſubject, that hath ſo ſplendid an aſpect: yet I do not expect to paſſe this Diſcourſe through a vicious world and various tempers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:179860:4"/> ſome reflections; the vain and vicious will be apt to quarrel at the confinement they will finde to their unlimitted fancyes and humour; the Critick will ſay, it is too trivially managed to pleaſe their curioſity, they can neither finde elegancy of ſtile, nor the advantage of Hiſtory, which they will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm are uſually the moſt proper and principal parts of ſuch an undertaking as this is, the ſubject in the nature of it is ſo rich, that it needs no varaiſh to ſet it off, the reward and pleaſure which attends it is enough to commend it without complement; and indeed I deſignedly omitted quotations, not that I ſlighted Hiſtory, but partly becauſe I intended only to give my own particular notion of Friendſhip, as alſo what I had collected from my own experience and obſervation; and partly that I might leave ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient encouragement to perſons of more leaſure and ability to enter upon this ſubject, and add that part which is not only moſt material for illuſtration and confirmation, but the moſt delightful part of the whole concern; I mean in relation to the compoſure of it, becauſe as the experience of others is greatly confirming to the ſubject, ſo it is no leſſe pleaſing to the Author, who is never better ſatisfied then when the truths he aſſerts come attended with a cloud of witneſſes; beſide the Author of this preſent book may receive no ſmall advantage, becauſe hereby thoſe errors may be corrected which unavoidably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo unskilful an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker: But not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or carry the Reader any further from my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Subject, I ſhall leave him with with this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that I am his,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſubject of the enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is of that excellency and importance, that it deſerves our diligence in the enquiring into the nature of it; it is the great Miſtery of Friendſhip which contains in it things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, weighty and exceeding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary both for the pleaſure of the ſenſitive and rational appetite: men are tired in the chaſe of ſatisfaction from one thing to another, ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing thoſe ſhadows that cannot be brought nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and the reaſon is, that in the humane nature there is an intenſe and continual deſire of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without which life it ſelf hath no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for life conſiſting in the operations of the ſoul, either the external of the ſenſes, or the internal of the minde, it is ſweetned by thoſe delights that are ſuitable to them: the ſubject I am upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179860:5"/> bids faireſt for a temporal ſatisfaction; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in it ſelf thoſe excellent accompliſhments which are the intermedial ſteps by which we climb and get within reach of it: Philoſophers in their vaſt enquiries into natural things were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo buſie wholly to decline this moral concern, and in the concluſion when they made up their experiments, they never reckoned thoſe they found in the way of friendſhp inferior or leſs conſiderable then thoſe that were bound up in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſes; for beſide the conveniency they finde in this relation for the uſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their natural acquirements, they arrive at more true and ſolid contentment: men in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing effects to their cauſes, as they finde pleaſure, ſo they finde labour, and many diſappointments, their knowledge not ſeldome proving the fruit of anxious enquiries, which mightily abates their content, and often they take up with little things they finde in their way, while they ſtill remain ſhort of the end they deſigne; but Friendſhip, as it hath not ſuch cragged and obſcure ways, ſo it hath more certain and direct ends: men do not in this concern like fooliſh Chymiſts, who melt a great part of their eſtate in vain in expectation of the great <hi>Elixir,</hi> ſuch have riches and treaſures in notion and fancy, little in poſſeſſion; but it is quite contrary here; Friends have leaſt in notion, moſt in poſſeſſion; when they attain this generous ſtate, they finde a reall enjoyment of what they thirſted after; we do not value things only for their intrinſick beauty, but that which raiſeth the value, is the accomodation they have in them to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:179860:5"/> our ſatisfaction, that is the more deſirable part: now as there is nothing in all the creation ſo good as man, ſo there is nothing ſo ſuitable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, as man himſelf; and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ingenious men finde ſo much content among themſelves; and this cannot but advance their content exceedingly, the ſymmetry and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion men have in their natures and diſpoſitions is the greateſt content: ſatisfaction is derived from ſimilitude, if this be wanting, however things may appear, they are really unpleaſant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful; like a garment that is too looſe, or too ſtraight, however it may pleaſe and humour pride, it will not content the perſon, becauſe it wants proportion to that part to which it was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. Friends act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> many parts in this relation, and all tend to profit and the pleaſure of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſometimes they act high, and then they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the pleaſure of the minde by communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge and experience ſuperiour and conſonant to the intelligent nature, other times they act ſo as to gratify ſences, which is both ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and convenient, if a due obſervation and ſubordination be allowed to the rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſo equal ſatisfaction according to the ſeveral objects is obtained: theſe and many other inviting properties you will find in this concern, if you pleaſe to enter with me into the nature of it. But ſome perſons are averſe to all vertue, and conſequently to this concern, others through inadvertency wave and neglect the purſuit of it from a ſuppoſed incapacity in themſelves, or the difficulty that lies in their way to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179860:6"/> of it; this proceeds either from ignorance and unacquantance with this concern, or from a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unconcerned temper; the firſt ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther animate, and quicken then obſtruct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede, becauſe nothing is more incident to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of men, then to prize thoſe things moſt that are ſcarce and rare, thoſe of an eaſie and cheap deſcent bege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, There is a Chriſtian Friendſhip.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:179860:7"/>
            <p>Secondly, A common and univerſal Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A relative Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A morral Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Of the Chriſtian Friendſhip: I ſhall not ſay any thing to this, but that it is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, ſweet and durable Friendſhip, and moſt to be ambitioned and deſired.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a common Friendſhip which we have with all the world as our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and this is more or leſs according to our intereſt in them, or their merit and deſert; this is the meaſure of this Friendſhip; the rule that we go by is the benefit &amp; advantage we expect, &amp; the accomodation that it hath in it to our ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and tranquillity, and other ſuch like ends; or from charity which we are morally diſpoſed to as rational creatures: Friendſhip take it how you will, is very deſirable; conſider it under this conſideration as it is expatiated, or in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſence where it is confined, in all reſpects it is eminent: this common Friendſhip is as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral an advantage as the ſun, for as the ſun influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and enlightens the world, ſo Friendſhip preſerves a world for that light and influence: were it not for this binding and regulating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, men like beaſts would devour one another, every man naturally ambitioning rule and hating ſubjection: were it not for this confinement that hath an univerſal influence upon all perſons and tranſactions, what tyranny would reign in the Courts of Princes? what rebellion among ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? by this binding concern Princes are made
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179860:7"/> almoſt unlimitable, and ſubjects moſt free: it is the undiſſembled affection of Princes upon which the freedom and happineſs of the people are firmly planted: Friendſhip, is that which ſecures Families, otherwiſe all things would be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion there; Brethren like <hi>Cain</hi> would riſe up one againſt another, and a mans enemies be them of his own houſe: beſides this, the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice would yer go higher, and all men muſt ſtand as in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, with their weapons in one hand, and work in the other: ſince the progeny of <hi>Adam</hi> is encreaſed to a vaſt ſociety and numerous iſſue, all manner of diſaſters, as Famine, Peſtilence, Deluge, Fire, Wilde Beaſts, have not been ſo deſtructive of man as man himſelf, which was occaſioned by this want of Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Thlrdly, There is a Friendſhip among Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as that between Father and ſon, Husband and Wife, and Brethren, theſe Relations make Friendſhips, and ſuch as muſt not give place to any other; and this proceeds from natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which obliges to duty and Obligations not to be violated; of which I ſhall ſpeak more in another place.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is a Frendſhip that is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded purely upon moral Principles, and for diſtinction we call it a moral Friendſhip: here is no Obligation preceeding, as in that of relation, but every man is left to his free choice and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is governed by prudential and moral ſwaſion; a Father beſide his own inclination is bound to love his ſon, the law of nature bindes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179860:8"/> him to it, and a ſon his Father in like manner; but no man is bound to love any perſon with a complacential love, nor can he do it, except ſuch an one that he can finde upon prudent conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons agreeable to his reaſon and fancy, theſe are the moſt proper and powerful motives to excite the affections: Friendſhip is equal in it ſelf to all the world, and hath no difference, but is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by accidents, and by the capacities or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacities of them that receive it; charity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us not to be enemies to any, and reaſon and prudence directs us to be moſt friendly to them that are moſt uſeful and deſerving: if we have reaſon to love many, we have much more reaſon to love ſome more then others; and if my affection be according to reaſon, I muſt love moſt where I ſee moſt reaſon: this moral friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as it flows from the moſt generous principles ſo it produceth the moſt deſirable effects; we may make an eſtimate of it by its cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, ſor its cauſes it derives either from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive candour and generofity of minde, or from a noble and ingenious education, or ſomething jointly from both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe ſeem as good originals as any thing meerly moral can proceed from; and hence it is that we finde thoſe of great minds and extraction moſt obliging; whereas thoſe of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject births and ſpirits are of a quite differing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ths firſt are governed by reaſon which is ſtill the ſame, and will act equally and conſonant to it ſelf, excluding an arbitrary will; for he that doth things this moment becauſe he will, may the next have as weighty arguments to do ſome
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179860:8"/> contrary, and ſo ſpend his whole time in unravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his ſpiders webs, ſtill lying under the laſh of the ſuperiour faculties, which will be conſtantly following him with grating reflections, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt its more direct admonitions, numerous are the effects that proceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from this cauſe: I ſhall point at two or three briefly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, men are hereby made ſo like God, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more aſſimilate man to God, love being a ſupream attribute of the unchangeable being, &amp; prepares and enables us to a conformiry, to the Divine Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Friendſhip calls home our wandring fancy, that haply may range after a thouſand va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which may allure the affections, but can never ſatisſie them, and contracts them to objects that are ſolid and excellent: all men naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire after happineſs, but few finde it, becauſe they either miſtake the way or the end; ſome place it in wiſdom, ſome in honour, others in riches, taking up with ſomething ſhort of the great end; there is more ſatisfaction to be had in a faithful ſerious friend then in all ſublunary things; nothing can reach our content, but that which can rationally engage the affections, and this cannot be done by riches, humane reaſon or pleaſure: we may adde, the moſt binding rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the moſt powerful obligations that pleaſure can invent, not any of theſe nor all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether can do it, and that becauſe there is not worth enough in them to attract the heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, nor weight enough in them to ſatisfie reaſon, nor power to lay any reſtraint upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:179860:9"/> paſſions &amp; unlimited fancies, but friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can do all this: there is love to attract, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo attractive as love it ſelf: it comes always attended with the lucre of reward and pleaſure: and hcreby it inſinuates it ſelf and lays conſtraints and limitations upon the perſon inſenſibly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force or violence, and ſo makes an abſolute conqueſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Friendſhip is exemplary vertue, and carries in its front the cleareſt conviction of vice: Philoſophers were of opinion that no true love could be amongſt any but ingenious men: perſons that are vicious cannot build their wood, hay and ſtubble upon ſo ſolid a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as that of friendſhip, yet this concern harh ſuch credit with the worſt of men, that it hath not wanted advocates among its greateſt enemies, which though they have been never ſo vicious and induſtrious to defame vertue and condemn it as men do the light, becauſe their weak eyes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive the luſter of it, yet they judge it moſt amicable, and they can beſtow praiſes upon ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men, and commend the radency of that ſtate they employ their utmoſt power to circumvent and deſtroy: they can as well hold a Lion in a twine thred as confine their unruly paſſions, and graſp the air as give check to one luſt: theſe are the unhappy ſubjects of thoſe skilful Artificers that vitiate men in their perſons to corrupt their principles, and when all hopes of vertue is loſt, they will eaſily be perſwaded into all the infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a contrary ſtate: theſe are ſo deeply plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in vice, that they are contented that the laſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:179860:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhould be raiſed upon the ruine of the firſt, and while they catch after the one with impetuous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, they can tamely endure the other to be vilifyed and deſpiſed: whereas virtuous men can view them in their hurry and maze, though with pity to them, with ſatisfaction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while they with ſerenity and a calm minde can regulate their opinions, and confine a wandring fancy, and reduce things to their juſt value: and however this looſe age, the dreg of times, may contemn things in themſelves moſt deſerving, magnifying an arbitrary will, and trampling upon all that oppoſe it, theſe look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Trophees as miſerable that is built upon vertue and honour; as a clear day befriends us with more diſtinct proſpect of diſtant objects, ſo when there is quietneſs within, then we can look about us, and ſee what excellencys invite the reaſon and affection: when vain men as a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their ſenſuality are clouded; and it is not ſeldom, that melancholy, that black paſſion overſpreads the mind like an Egyptian darkneſs, admitting no allay, but hurrying men blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold into their own ruine: Let none think this a ſcheme of diſcourſe, ſince there is nothing more common then to ſee men vitiate their principles as well as their duties, and be worſe then their nature inclines them to: many evils are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the grain, and with violence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: if the beſt ſenſuality be too trifling to maintain any proportion with vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, how far wide muſt they needs be that ſtand in competition with vertue; thoſe that have ſuch
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:179860:10"/> degenerate wills as that they can exchange liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for licentiouſneſs, have loſt their freedom, and are contracted to low and baſe objects: I would gladly vindicate vertue, and make it il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, it is my deſigne in this Diſcourſe: there is but one way for the obtaining that end, and that is by making it as radiant as I can, that by the ſplendour of it mens eyes may be drawn off from worſe objects; but ſome ſpirits are ſo diſ-ingenious, that the moſt glorious rewards will not animate them, like brutes they are not concerned in all the happineſs to be found above in the region of reaſon, but would relinquiſh or reſigne any portion there, ſo they may ſecure and enjoy husks and draught: theſe prodigally ſpend their time and treaſure upon ſuch trifles that will reward them with poverty and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the certain reward and portion of thoſe that are not capable of more generous reſentments; but it is time to take leave of this digreſſion, and come to the point.</p>
            <p>The next thing that comes under our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is, <hi>what a Moral Friendſhip imports:</hi> It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the cloſeſt union, the moſt generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, thc ſweeteſt communion, the ſtrongeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions between perſons that ſtudy nothing more then the ſatisfaction one of another in all things both divine and humane.</p>
            <p>I purpoſe not to ſpeak to every individual part of this Propoſition, that would take up more time then I have deſigned for this undertaking, and ſwell this little Tract to a volume; as alſo beeauſe I ſhall occaſionally take them all in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:179860:10"/> Diſcourſe that ſollows, I ſhall only at preſent explain my meaning in a general way, and ſo proceed: By Union I mean a union of hearts, which is moſt exeellent as to its original and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; it hath a higher cauſe, and derives from the moſt noble ſpring, and its conſequents are proportionate: It is natural to every producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bear ſymetry and proportion to that which produceth it; from this heart-union ſprings the moſt complacential communion and fellowſhip: Friendſhip is love and ſociety mixt together, which make it moſt delightful in this ſociable ſtate; men do not only meet with uſeful diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:179860:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> boſome, leſt our ignorant occaſions, our vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and trouble in caſe of diſappointment, our haſty fixing upon ſome unequal object, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnares the affection and betrays them, ſo it puts an undervalue upon the judgment: men that have made an unequal choice how many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies do they draw upon themſelves, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the head is diſtracted, and this is deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of their peace and tranquillity: the head is filled with troubleſom notions and contrivances, how it may handſomely manage a breath in that friendſhip that can neither rationally be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor credibly broken, that is a grating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that diſcovers errours in thoſe things to which the heart is nearly united; how to unite that knot that cannot be looſed without many a piece of ſelf-denial is not eaſily learned, becauſe it cannot be done without grief and trouble: a ſeparation from them we dearly love is very hard, though never ſo good reaſon appears for it, paſſion being violent, wilfull and impetuous, eaſily ſeduced in the firſt choice, afterward hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reclaimed: for as nothing is more eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed then the fancy, ſo nothing will be more hardly convinced of its errour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The lower appetite may be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by precipitancy, for the troubles of the minde hath a mighty influence upon the body, and they often torment one the other: the pains of the body proves no ſmall detriment to the minde; ſharp pains in the body ſo diſcompoſeth the mind, that its made unfit for its high &amp; noble operations, ſo that it cannot perform its acts with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:179860:12"/> that delight and freedom: Philoſophers took a great deal of care ſpeedily to cure all diſtempers of the body, that no obſtruction thereby might impede the purſuit of knowledge: As the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the minde mightily prepares for every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious action, ſo perturbation hath a quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect, and ſo diſtracts the minde that it proves the greateſt prejudice imaginable, becauſe we often loſe our reaſon in that croud which is the only expedient to prevail with us againſt any thing unneceſſary or vexatious: This is a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, that nothing ſerious can be done in haſte; Friendſhip is a ſerious thing, and muſt be well weighed both in its ſubſtance and circumſtances; Theſe things are very material in order to a well-grounded friendſhip, that there be excellency in the minde, ſweetneſs and affability in the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reality in the affection; if we cannot be ſatisfied in all theſe, we can expect to arrive at no better end then diſappointment; now to acquaint our ſelves with all theſe, will require no ſmall diligence and obſervation, which will employ our moſt ſerious thoughts, and take up a conſiderable time: if a man be a ſervant to the meaneſt thing, upon which he placeth an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection, as indeed he is, then this ſhould awaken all our powers to contemplate this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; leſt while we aim at pleaſure we careleſly inſlave our ſelves: It is not notion but experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that fixeth content, as nothing can deſtroy our happineſs but the experience of evil, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can eſtabliſh our ſatisfaction but the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of good: there is as much deceit in men as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:179860:12"/> there is in ſtones, men may inſinuate themſelves by ſpecious pretences, yet groſs deceivers; It is hard for a man that is blinded with pride or paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any other deluſion, to underſtand himſelf; he is not ſeldom betrayed by himſelf, much leſs can he be underſtood by another: there are ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men as well as ſhining ſtones, otherwiſe that proverb had never been, <hi>All is not gold that gliſters;</hi> we know many a ſtone hath the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond cut and colour, yet but a counterfeit, and when we think we have a treaſure, it proves but a trifle: many men that through raſhneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration fix their affection before experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had of the true value of the object, are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheated, prodigally giving away their hearts without any aſſurance of ſutable returns; and hence it comes to paſs, that we ſee ſome frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip broken and ſhattered, and in a ſhort time moulder and come to nothing; the Materials were deceitful; like a houſe that is ſlightly built, it appears ſtrong and fair to the eye, but ſoon decays; the defect was in the foundation, which though leaſt ſeen is moſt dangerous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, our too early fixing, as it inſnareth the affection, ſo it condemns the judgment; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will think themſelves concerned here, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the moſt vicious, that are curious in nothing but in praying into and ſearching after the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others; ſuch inquiſitions being more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural &amp; gratifying extravagant humours, who are moſt ready to cenſure what they leaſt underſtand, and make cauſleſs exceptions, which if rightly argued, they cannot anſwer one of a thouſand. Frendſhip may be envied, it cannot be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179860:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> while it remains pure and entire, yet upon the leaſt failer it is liable to the greateſt reproach and ſcorn: When <hi>Huſhai Davids</hi> friend came to <hi>Abſalom</hi> he was glad to ſee him, yet how ready doth he upbraid him, ſaying, <hi>Is this thy kindneſs to thy friend? Abſalom</hi> was one of the worſt of men, and the greateſt traitor, but he hated trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery notwithſtanding: few men ſo barbarous as to love deceit, hence that Proverb came, that <hi>men love the Treaſon but hate the Traitor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greateſt ground of condemnation is drawn from this, eſpecially our inconſiderateneſs in the firſt choice and election, where we ought to have been moſt curious and circumſpect, and this is aggravated by two ungrateful circumſtances: Firſt, this ſeems to be a fundamental errour, and therefore moſt dangerous, and then it's obvious to vulgar inſpection and obſervation; and this is a grating aggravation, and comes attended with exclamations, and often enforces a man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a kindeneſs to a perſon he could never do upon any other account then this, that he might defend his judgement from cenſure, and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of frendſhip from ſcorn and contempt; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more contrary to an ingenious man then to own a kindeneſs for him that once deceived him, eſpecially in ſo material a concern as that of frendſhip, where he expected the contrary; yet prudence will not ſuffer him to deny him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly: it's in this caſe as with him that hath bought a Jewell, which he thought moſt precious, but was cheated, that man will be aſhamed to own the deceit, becauſe thereby his ignorance is

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:179860:14"/> natural inclination, ſo rational creatures are wrought upon and inſenſibly drawn by moral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, as the foreſight of rewards or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings annexed invites them: Frendſhip cannot be without commands; if that be true, that the diſpenſing of benefits acquire to the giver a right to command, and lays on the receiver an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obey, and theſe rights and obligations are meaſured by the nature of the benefit as their juſt rule: This is a <hi>Maxim,</hi> that every rational man readily aſſents to, no commands ſo pleaſing as thoſe of love: no duty ſo eaſy; becauſe as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are eaſie without reſtraint, ſo they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual without violence and oppreſſion, which ſweetly obliges to Obedience.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That we may be ſecured in ſo weighty a matter, and build the material concern upon firm <hi>baſes,</hi> know this, that not only reaſon but religion is neceſſary as the moſt tranſcendant and pregnant argument to engage the will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, thoſe that are learned in the work of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs are the moſt excellently qualified for this concern: I admit a Frendſhip may be made between perſons meerly moral; where there may be equality there may be amity, but it cannot be ſo ſure and ſafe as the Chriſtian Frendſhip, one being founded in heaven the other on earth; ſo that there is as much difference between them as between heaven and earth, and as their originals are unequal, ſo their objects and operations are unequal; reaſon cannot bear equal pace with religion, though it may ariſe high in reſpect of ſence, yet it is very low compared with faith; I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:179860:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> grant, that religion connot make Frendſhip com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat except rational accompliſhments and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral requiſites concur; as reaſon cannot convey grace, ſo religion cannot convey reaſon: many Idiots without queſtion are pious, yet not in any caſe capable of Frendſhip, becauſe there muſt be reaſon as well as religion to regulate things: that religion is not ſufficient of it ſelf to make Frendſhip, the caſe of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> makes undeniable, who through diſpute and difference did that which is againſt the nature of Frendſhip, they parted and probably never met again; we cannot think they were enemies, but certainly they were leſs friends; this muſt be granted, where the reſtraint in Frendſhip begins, there begins the imperfection of it; and without any queſtion the moral Frendſhip was broken, only the Chriſtian Frendſhip remained intire, we muſt needs run a mighty hazard in making alliances with perſons impious: Firſt, the devil will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne a breach, either by planting in us ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding principles, and afterward he will be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to draw out theſe principles into divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding practiſes: ſometimes God himſelf will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne a breach, if God intend either party for himſelf, enmity will ſoon grow between them, there being a certain antipathy between the ſeed of the woman and the ſeed of the ſerpent: do not we ſee God curſe the greateſt comforts of the carnal men, and blaſt their faireſt hopes, and nip their promiſing bloſſoms? but if there be truth in the inward parts, and piety bears the ſway, the Frendſhip will be eſtabliſhed: and becauſe the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179860:15"/> beſt Frendſhips may ſometimes want pleaſure, but never trouble, we had need be careful that we have an intereſt in him that can turn our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of affliction into the wine of conſolation.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Fourth thing, namely, the equality that muſt be in the perſons of friends previous to this concern: and here we ſhall firſt examine the perfections of the minde, and then thoſe inferiour though neceſſary requiſites to compleat this equality: the perſons muſt have in them that which will do theſe things, ſatisfie reaſon in a competent meaſure, raviſh and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the affection, and preſerve harmony and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in all the tranſactions that relates to this concern: thoſe that are untainted with prejudice, and by being ſo have their judgments clear and unbiaſſed, conſider ſeriouſly the happineſs of this concern: Frendſhip is not guided by humour and fancy which hath much more ſway among the vulgar then judgment and reaſon, and that makes them ſo uncertain, they can ſhuffle paſſions, and hate next hour, what juſt now they adored; but it is a grave and deliberate act of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and will, whereby we come to a right eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of things; the rational faculties, which are the underſtanding and will, if rightly guided, are not to be ſlightly ſatisfied; outward blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments will not do it, it muſt be ſomething that is really good, as that which is ſo fubtilly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed under an appearance of good, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſcovered: things being thus prefented to the will, it cloſeth with them by a free and unconſtrained choice, and the affections are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:179860:15"/> inſenſibly, vertue being the only ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating quality: for the better directing our inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it will be requiſite to enquire what thoſe qualities are that are univerſally and indiſpenſibly neceſſary, in order to the anſwering thoſe great ends before-mentioned: I conceive theſe three things will fully do it. <hi>Eirſt,</hi> worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the minde, that will ſatisfie reaſon as to the choice of the object, that it is not baſe and abject but valuable: <hi>Secondly,</hi> courteous and affable conditions and inclinations, this will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the affection: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſuch an equality as will anſwer in every thing requiſite in this mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial concern, and this will both create and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve harmony and agreement in all tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and is the beauty and comelineſſe of Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; when there is an Uniformity obſerved in things, how ſplendidly do they appear? and the more excellent the things are in themſelves, the more lovely they appear in uniformity: Frendſhip is not only to raiſe and inflame the heart with the love of the object in order to a ſenſual ſatisfaction, though that be neceſſary, becauſe from thence the felicity of the animal life proceeds, but rather to improve the ſuperiour faculties in order to a rational ſatisfaction, from whence the pleaſure of the minde proceeds; now our judgement and reaſon is abundantly ſatisfied, when we finde in the object of our affections the habits and acts of reaſon; for as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reaſon inhances the value of the perſon, ſo the practiſes benefits others, not only as an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though that be much, but as an improvement
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:179860:16"/> of our knowledge and experience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we will conſider reaſon in its ſuperlative degree, as a King upon his throne, when reaſon keeps the throne, the will is right, and its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions juſt and equal, ſo that the inferiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are eaſily drawn to a ſubordination to its dictates and admonitions, and the affections are exerciſed with proportion to the quality of their objects, and reaſon is their inviolable rule, and love the ſupreme affection that gives being to all the reſt, to hatred it ſelf; for ſo much we hate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing as it ſtands between and impedes our enjoyment of what we love; the rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hath objects that highly excels thoſe of the ſenſitive, their capacities are more ſpatious, and their union with the object more cloſe and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, their perception more clear, and thereby become the greateſt inſtruments of pleaſure to the intelligent nature: the higheſt faculties are the underſtanding and will, to which the deſire of knowledge is moſt natural, and produceth the nobleſt and ſweeteſt pleaſure; and this according to the perfection and enjoyment of the object, proportionable to the degrees of excellency there is in any object, ſo much rational ſatisfaction accrues to the minde by the knowledge of it: Natural things greatly affect an intelligent man in his enquiring into their nature, I mean the works of God and his providential diſtributions, yet the excellencies they finde there are but dark and faint reſemblances of the infinite &amp; unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perfection, the deſire of knowledge both natural and moral is marvellous quick and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:179860:16"/> and in appearance, moſt worthy the rational nature, as being exceeding pleaſant and delicious to the ſoul: the retirements of nature are not without thoſe excellencies which invite the ſearch of intelligent men, but the miſtery of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity hath much more perfection in the nature of it, to animate and quicken our enquiries, and that becauſe knowledge is attained here with leſs labour, more certainty, and with greater delight and pleaſure; and the reaſon is, we get ſome ſteps nearer the original of all perfection; the Impreſſions of God are ingraven upon all his works, but ſo darkly, that many naturally wiſe men could hardly finde light enough in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural lamps to diſcover the true nature and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of him: now morallity aſcends much nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, it is a proſpect that makes clearer diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and hereby we aſcend ſo near perfection, that we may diſcover much of the nature and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the unchangeable and glorious being, yet this is but a glimmering light, and a low per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection comparatively, and will never reach hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; there is a ſtrong inclination in men to be happy, this deſire is born and bred up with him, and it is the firſt and univerſal principle from whence all moral conſequences are derived: this is the rule of our deſire, and the end of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as in natural things the principle of their production operate according to their quality, ſo in moral things the end is as powerful to form the ſoul for its operations in order to it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as all deſire to be happy, ſo they apply themſelves to thoſe means that hath a tendency to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:179860:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> it: men frame happineſs according to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and the apprehenſions of it are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the condition of the perſons: for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the pleſure that derives from the harmony and agreement that there is between the object and the appetite, that we may come to a more perfect knowledge of the ſupream being, and ſo conſequently be more happy then any man, though never ſo richly accompliſhed can be any other way: we muſt cloſe with religion to this capacity the beams of divine light are extended; it is not my deſigne ſo to magnifie humane reaſon as to neglect that knowledge that is divine, nor is it according to our method wholly to reſt there; the great import of Frendſhip as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed was to ſtudy the happineſs one of another in all things both divine and humane; it is true, there is a ſecret acknowledgment in every mans breaſt of a ſuperiour power to whom he muſt give an account, this he hath by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet the clearneſs of the underſtanding i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:179860:20"/> be compleat, could they confine their noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and experiences within the narrow territories of their own minds: Now that they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves of the burthens of their weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conceptions, which they may do while they retain the worth of them, and finde out a way for their capatious ſouls to empty themſelves: They court all opportunities, among which Frendſhip preſents its ſelf as moſt ſuitable and proper, becauſe receptive of all thoſe generous overtures which are propounded, and ſo the will and affection are immediatly engaged, freely without any force or violence, to cloſe with Frendſhip, as the moſt convenient ſcene upon which they may act thoſe ſerious contrivances that terminate in vertue and honour: It is in this ſtate and relation men chearfully purſue golden deſignes, and make uſe of thoſe excellent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments they have been long gathering, but by ſome harſh accident and unhappy incapacity have been hid and obſcured: Now Frendſhip mainly intending the improvement of reaſon and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, every way both to the giver, and receiver immediatly puts upon that employment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the moſt curious ſearches ſeems but idle things, and that is communication, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men both improve themſelves and others; It is true, habitual excellency beautifies the minde, but it muſt be extended beyond that, elſe the reputation, which is very conſiderable among vertuous men will loſe much honour; the more general the inffuence, the greater the glory, like the ſun whoſe glory doth not only conſiſt in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179860:20"/> body, though that be all light, and the ſountain of light, but alſo in the ſpreading beams; they being of the moſt general advantage: But to bring this argument yet nearer our purpoſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that wiſe men in their firſt attempts, in order to the demonſtrating of their parts, are not haſty, raſh and precipitate; they will friendly diſcourſe their notions before they will ſcatter them publickly; this is readily aſſented to, that the moſt accompliſhed men are not ſecured from miſtakes, which will ofttimes attend unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the moſt wary undertaker: men cannot ſo exactly ſhape their beſt thoughts, as that they ſhould appear comely to all, nor can he promiſe himſelf an exemption at all times from miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, paſſion or ſome other accident which may intervene between the intention and the action, theſe are incident to every man, and can be no more divided from the pureſt conſtitutions and innocent lives then light from the ſun: Again, conſiderate men are not ſo taken with their early conceptions as to believe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exceptions or improvement, and none can ſo freely, innocently and without noiſe do it, as a faithful and judicious friend, who cannot be ſuſpected of envy or partiality on the other ſide: who more fit to pay thoſe juſt acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then he who will as chearfully commend any worthy quality as he would tenderly, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and carefully detect the contrary; that this act of Frendſhip is a ſingular advantage, will further appear upon this enquiry which follows: Examine great Schools and publike communities
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179860:21"/> and Academies, and you will finde they are not only intended for the ſtudy of Learning in their ſeveral apartments, but alſo for the benefit of Communion in a ſociable converſation, whereby learning is improved and extended in order to the publick benefit of the whole ſociety: We are not without multitude of examples of this kinde, it is by diſcourſe truth is diſputed, errour is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged; the true meaſure of the capacity and incapacities of men lies originally in that rule that the art or ſcience he is about to acquire preſcribes, but the uſe is more extenſive, and ſo the meaſure is in every mans hand that hath skill to uſe it; and hereby a man comes to make a right eſtimate of all things, by applying the rule to them, which is done by diſcourſing with our ſelves or others: words are the ſhaping of the thoughts, and rally them into order and form: thoughts are beſt diſcerned in their dreſs whether they are trivial or weighty; naked thoughts ſometimes affright us, we dare not look on them, till by words they are adorned, and ſo made amiable; othertimes they ſeem ſo aiery that we cannot hold them, they ſlip from us; but when we have ſhaped them we have greater command of them, and can hold them till we have exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, and at laſt we have liberty to keep them or reject them, according to their deſert and merit: a mans firſt conceptions may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vervalued or undervalued by accidents, as when melancholy or pride interpoſeth: Melancholy will not ſtay ſo long upon thoughts, being of a roving temper, or till they may be ſcanned, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:179860:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> pride will examine them overly and ſlightly, becauſe it thinks it cannot erre: We deal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly and judiciouſly when we examine things ſo as that we come to a right underſtanding of the nature of them, and can give every thing its true value without leſſening their luſtre, which conſiſts in their nature, uniformity and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: It was the advice of a Grandee, eminent for Learning, and of an excellent judgment, that men ſhould diſcourſe their thoughts and when opportunities were not to be had of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing them otherwiſe, rather then wholly omit this neceſſary concern, they ſhould direct their diſcourſe to a ſtatue; but he that hath a faithful friend need not put himſelf upon this concluſion: Familiar converſe is always pleaſant and often very profitable and ſeaſonable; <hi>Two wits are better then one,</hi> is a Proverb not to be ſlighted: I may ſee an errour in my Friend he may not ſee in himſelf, without being over-cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and this may be ſo argued, that he may be convinced, and his reputation ſecured from reproach and ſcandal.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there muſt be that in the object we pitch upon for Frendſhip, that muſt raviſh the affections, and that ſeems to be candour and affability in diſpoſitions and converſation, this is as neceſſary in order to content and the pleaſure of this concern, as reaſon is in order to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it: as reaſon is neceſſary, ſo love and an equal converſation is as neceſſary, this was that which firſt created and ſtill ſupports it; nothing ſo indearing as civility and courteſie; and this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:179860:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> keeps up the reputation of Frendſhip in ſpight of all that envy that malicious perſons conceive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: no cloud can ecclipſe the radiancy of this concern, when it is clothed with civility and courteſie, this is the conſtraining property of kindneſs, and in this ſence objects hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining force, though properly they have none, but derive their efficacy from the faculties to which they are agreeable: we may underſtand the excellency of this temper by comparing it with thoſe that are of moroſe and harſh ſpirits, ſuch hath croſſneſs ſo natural to them, being born and bred up with them, that they cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: what torment are ſuch perſons to themſelves? every the leaſt contradiction ſo inflames and ſo ſtrangely tranſports them, and that to ſuch amazing paſſions, that they are not only ungrateful to others but frightful to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they arrive to ſuch extravagancies that miſchievous effects follow upon them: they are juſtly termed mad, elſe they would not bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves a greater miſchief that they may do a leſs; theſe perſons are not fit for any ſerious undertaking; but now a calm and affable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reduces paſſions, and ſo fortifies themſelves againſt them, that they neither diſquiet their own minds, nor others patience: theſe can paſs by the greateſt injuries inſenſibly; how prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do they interpret all things in the beſt ſence that are meant in the worſt they do ſee, as to pity, but are blinde as to prejudice: theſe do not practiſe curioſity and a near inſpection into the faults of others, and yet will ſeverely enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:179860:22"/> vice, without grating &amp; unbraiding how ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is ſuch a diſpoſition, and moſt incomparably fit for this great concern? this temper hath many excellent properties; I ſhall hint at ſome: It is free, pleaſant and complaſant; Love is noble, and admits the beloved into the heart, and gives him a peculiar intereſt there, and in all that he hath beſides, intereſt is ſo great a part of Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that we conclude, no Intereſt no Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: It is the true meaſure of Love; as Intereſt is more or leſs perſect, ſo is the affection more or leſs compleat; proportionable to the intereſt, ſuch is the Frendſhip: All thoſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have been diſcourſing of, are inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant to a perſon without intereſt, like the Gold in the <hi>Indies;</hi> only valuable in themſelves, but of little value to others which are at a diſtance: It is intereſt that inhanceth the worth of any thing, propriety is very indearing and obliging; it puts a beauty upon our enjoyments; how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is it for men to ſlight that in the poſſeſſion of another they admire, when the property is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and they can call it their own.</p>
            <p>Again, Frendſhip is pleſant without thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities that attend other relations; as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of friends are more equal, ſo their commerce and fellowſhip is more pleaſing; equality ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſociety: Frendſhip is compounded of love and ſociety: how pleaſant are thoſe harmleſs diverſions that conſtantly attend thoſe ſociable companions? and that which makes it the more ſweet, is the utility and neceſſiity of it for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of the minde, that may and will be tired in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:179860:23"/> the moſt beneficial and excellent employments: the moſt diligent perſon cannot be always upon the wing, the lower appetite muſt have content as well as the ſuperiour; for as the diſturbances in the fenſes much prejudice the operations of the minde, ſo that it cannot act either profitably or pleaſantly for that particular ſeaſon; ſo when the minde is too intent, the ſences are prejudiced, and ſo much ſometimes, that they cannot enjoy thoſe vacancies that prudence and conveniency aſſigns them for the repairs of the body and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er appetite, which may be ſo: weary in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the rational appetite, that pleaſure may ſeem a burthen becauſe unſeaſonable, and they may prefer a ſleepy ſtupdity before the moſt grateful recreation; and the reaſon ſeems to be this becauſe ſence cannot bear equal pace with reaſon, the body with the minde; wiſe men in their moſt eager purſuit of knowledge had evermore a due reſpect to the body, which if impaired the minde could not make its returns either ſo pleaſant or beneficial as before: now it is the great deſigne of friends ſo to regulate their affairs that a general content ſhall be given both to ſence and reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anſwerable to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive capacity: Society as it is neceſſary upon a moral account, ſo it is moſt natural; God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preached this doctrine in paradice, <hi>it is not good for man to be alone; Adam</hi> was no other way unhappy, Paradiſe with all its pleaſure could not make up this want, his ſociable nature was not to be contented without it: <hi>Adam</hi> was as perfect in his primitive ſtate as any creature
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:179860:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> could poſſibly be; look into his underſtanding and there you will finde perfect light; into his will, and their exact rectitude; his affections all pure, without any droſs, his body full of beauty and comelineſs: add hereunto his conſtant communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God who treated him with no other terms but love and kindeneſs, yet after all this, the Lord as a further demonſtration of his favour to <hi>Adam,</hi> he aſſigns him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, the proportionableneſs of which is ſignified in that commendation he gives the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when he preſents her to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaying, <hi>ſhe was a help-meet for him:</hi> all this illuſtrates the pleaſure of ſociety. If <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe wanted ſociety that was happy in every thing elſe, how pleaſant muſt Frendſhip be to us that are happy in nothing elſe comparatively? what complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and delight muſt needs ſpring from a ſtate ſo peculiarly free and pleaſant, I might ſpeak much of the delight and ſatisfaction to be found in this regard, but that I ſhall reſerve to another place.</p>
            <p>The Fourth and laſt thing promiſed by way of preparation to this great concern is this, that there muſt be ſo much equality in the perſon &amp; capacity of Friends which will be commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and adequate in every thing material, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this rclation and ſtate of Frendſhip: for the better directing our inquiſition in this great caſe, a method will be neceſſary. I would explain my meaning here with all caution and circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I might not be miſ-underſtood, becauſe the intricacy of the whole Diſcourſe lies in this particular.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:179860:24"/>
            <p>Firſt, I do not mean by this equality ſuch an abſolute equality as will admit of no diſparity that is almoſt impoſſible, and certainly unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Men cannot meet in this concern as lines in the eenter, no man can perfectly underſtand the heights and depths of his own minde ſo as to make a certain eſtimate of them, and it muſt needs be without the reach of any other; as the accidents of life in ſome inferiour things may make a difference as to the outward ſtate, ſo the perfections of the minde, though not contrary may be unequal, and that becauſe one man may and doth excell another in particular things; and this is ſo far from cauſing a diſguſt, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth ſingular advantage; for as a worthy man is diſſatisfied though he hath treaſured up great things while they remain obſcure, ſo he is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contented to part them between himſelf and his friend, and no leſs is he delighted to ſee his own worth outvied by his friend: for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the one poſſeſſeth the other cannot want: no matter where the propriety is when the uſe is in both: the trade that Friends drive is giving and receiving in order to a mutual ſatisfaction: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide were this ſeeming diſparity wanting, friends would miſs one of their great ends: no man is loved for himſelf: It were well if we could love God at that rate: there is a vaſt expectation of profit and pleaſure among Friends, and much of their ſatisfaction lies in this, exchanging value for value, and hereby they are both gainers, and this upon a double account. Firſt they add each to others treaſure by ſome additional excellency,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:179860:24"/> and then to their content, becauſe its mutual: It is no cauſe of quarrel that one excels another in worthy qualities, the one never loſeth by the others gain; and then there is much more delight in ſubmitting the reaſon and wills in the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intercourſes and acts of Frendſhip, then can be any other way, and that becauſe there is more love expreſſed in thoſe acts, and the more of love is in any thing, the more ſweet, gratifying and contenting it is: But to come to particulars.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall endeavour to ſhew what are thoſe inequalities that are abſolute, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be otherwiſe, and then what inequality that is that may be diſpenſed with and taken up when prudence ſpeaks it neceſſary: That I may not in ſtead of explicating intricate this material con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, I ſhall promiſe theſe Four things wherein this inequality is to be found, and is ſo interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the compoſition and condition of the perſons that no prudence can take up.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The inequality between a Prince and a ſlave, a wiſe man and a fool, perſons of different perſwaſions in matters of religion, and in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſt place, that inequality that is in ſome Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               </gap>n unnatural and unreaſonable condeſcention.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There can be no equality between <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wiſe man and a fool; if a wiſe man cannot make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rendſhip with a perſon that is groſly ignorant,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:179860:25"/> becauſe of the diſparity that there is between them in reſpect of their reaſon, as I ſhall ſhew anon, much leſs with him that is ſo far from great reaſon, that he hath none at all: fools can never be ſo equallized as to comport with men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent reaſon, much leſs with wiſe men; their natures are made up of contradiction: there is that madneſs, wilfulneſs and folly in the one that cannot conſiſt with that gravity, wiſdom and humility of the other, as one can never be raiſed to any congruity with the other, ſo the other can never be ſo depreſſed and degenerated as to bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any proportion with him: no ſuch amity can ſtand with ſo great an inequality: I need not uſe any further argument for the confirmation of this aſſertion; Give me leave to ſpeak a word to the ſuppoſition, which is, that men of high parts &amp; ſublimated minds cannot be ſo equalized as to be made fit ſubjects for a Frendſhip with the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant: Men eminent in vertue, as they cannot in honour aſſociate themſelves with them that are vicious, ſo they cannot in wiſdom make alliance with the ignorant; and this will be yet more clear, if we conſider the diſtance they ſtand one to the other; a man of raiſed parts can never be ſo degenerated as to comport himſelf with them that are much inferiour; difference in perſon as to the outward ſtate is much, as appeared in the former inſtance between a Prince and a ſlave, but here it's more, becauſe there is all manner of diſtance both as to the minde and outward ſtate: what pleaſure can wiſe men take in ſowing barren ground, or ſcattering
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:179860:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> their precious ſeed in a Common, or at beſt to ſow among thorns, where the ſeed will never ſpring up to any ſatisfaction: Every ſecular bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſhall be admitted to come in and choak it; that in which wiſe men are moſt excellent, the other regards not; the more a man underſtands the more he makes neceſſary to himſelf, which thoſe of vicious ſpirits call madneſs, and abject and low ſpirits call needleſs curioſity; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of putting that worth upon noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous actions they deſerve, diſparage them by their ſlights and reflections; and ſo put an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value upon the perſon, who the higher they act, the more prejudicial the leaſt aſperſion caſt upon them proves to be; as from theſe ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable a condeſcention cannot be deſired, ſo from the other ſo great an elevation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected, that true worth, value and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that ſhould greaten their minds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their capacities: For ſuch alliance is a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle they can never underſtand, a jewel they would never be at the coſt to purchaſe becaufe they can never be brought to think it neceſſary, no ſuch enemy to learning as the ignorant, but here comes in an objection; Some will be ready to ſay, I exclude all perſons from Frendſhip, but thoſe that are ſtars of the firſt magnitude, and ſo conſequently moſt men and all women are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted: To this I anſwer, that I am not of that opinion, nor can I ſee any ground for it, I have laid down the rules of Frendſhip in the ſtricteſt ſence, as all material points ought to be, not ſuppoſing all can reach them; they that comes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:179860:26"/> neareſt do beſt: this muſt be allowed, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in vertues make a great difference in Frendſhips, as ſome men are more excellently qualified then others, ſo their alliances are more eſteemable, and fellowſhips more eminent: men differ in their extractions, natures and moral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements exceeding much; and then education addes much weight to all the reſt, if it be refined by art: it's true, nothing is more excellent then a natural <hi>genius</hi> when it is rightly directed, it is the ground-work and foundation of all ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but this is not alike in all, nature is more bountiful to ſome than others; and therefore art is intended to make up the defects of nature, and ſometimes it is ſo ſucceſsful in that behalf, that a man polliſhed by it comes to much perfection: we ſee boys that have been obſerved to be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accomodated in reſpect of natural ability, yet through the help of art, which by much diligence they have acquired, they have proved wiſe and uſeful men, though they could never arrive to that perfection that men both naturally wiſe and learned have done; there is as much difference between them as comparative and ſuperlative.</p>
            <p>But to come to the Queſtion, I conceive high parts and titles to be no more of the Eſſence of Frendſhip then gay clothes to be of the eſſence of a man: A man eminent in Titles and gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arayed, may appear more ſplendidly then he that is clothed in rags, but there is as much of the nature of a man in the latter as in the former: men not ſo highly raiſed in their parts, perſons and Eſtates as the former may make a moral
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:179860:26"/> Frendſhip, they have the capacity of it, and why not the ſignifications of it: a competent reaſon will ſerve among equalls: Men that look no higher then their particular calling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in the world, may have reaſon as to uſeful hearts as much united, their converſations as pleaſant, their actions as equal as thoſe that ſtand in a higher ſphere: as reaſon is not ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent among theſe, ſo they can be happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, becauſe they have not the ſame occaſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, Command and duty moſt be Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and there they ſeem unequal whereever they are, yet it may ſomtimes be otherwiſe: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:179860:28"/> there are many whoſe conditions are far wide from ſervitude, yet they are ſervants in a proper ſence, and muſt own an inequality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them &amp; their maſters, but this diſparity in the ſtricteſt ſence is but a ſubordination in ſome things, and for ſome ſpace of time, or ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular buſineſs when the time is expired, and the buſineſs finiſhed, the maſter and ſervant are both equal, the Inequallity did not conſiſt in the eſſential but in the circumſtantial part, not in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and condition, but in the art and ſcience which when taught and learned, the Maſter and ſervant are both equal; ſo that there remains no more diſtinction of Maſter and ſervant; but we will ſuppoſe the inequality yet greater, and that there is abſolute power in the Maſter to command without any reſtriction and proportionable obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations on the ſervant to obey beyond diſpute; yet it doth not follow, that theſe commands and duties are always alike, and that they can never be diſpenſed with; it is moſt true, it is not in the power of the inferiour to leſſen his own obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and duty, or extenuate the ſuperiour autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, yet the ſuperiour may abate and leſſen his own power, according to his will and pleaſure, and ſo they come to be more equal, though the one cannot ſhrink the other can ſtretch; a ſervant cannot upon any juſt pretence deny his obedience to his Maſter, yet his Maſter when it ſeems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient either for profit or pleaſure, or any other way expedient, can abate or leſſen his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the ſervant, without the leaſt injuſtice, and diſcharge him from any or all his obligations;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:179860:29"/> and this ſeems to be the way of princes, and the method that they uſe in raiſing perſons from a low condition to eminency; ſometimes it conſiſts with the ſagacity and prudence of a prince as well as his fancy, to advance men of low extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction but of noble ſpirits to places of high truſt and honour: ſome men by the vaſtneſs of their natural parts and ability, are moſt admirably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodated for the moſt honourable and noble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and for emergences of ſtate, may be more uſeful then thoſe much above them by extraction and titles: theſe cannot be admitted, though they are qualified for princely receptions, but by the favour of the prince extended toward them: and this doth not diminiſh nor impair the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the prince, or leſſen the ſubjects obligation, but rather advance and magnifie them; it brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the Princes glory and makes it more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it ſtrengthens the Favorites obedience, and makes them more faithful, though not ſo ſervile: ſuch condeſcentions ſwallows up much of the diſtance, ſo that they are not ſo unequal as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; greatneſs is neither debaſed nor diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by goodneſs; the ſun that glorious and raiſed body may ſhine upon a dunghill, yet looſes none of its glory, and though there be noiſomneſs in the dunghill, it can contract none of the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo princes when they ſhine upon their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites in the beams of their generoſity and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, their honour is not in the leaſt impaired thereby: there is no diſtance ſo unequal, but it may be taken up, except that which is ſo twiſted with the compofition of the perſons, that no art
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:179860:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> can looſen, and ſo natural to the relations, that it would be both impious and impudent to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it: and that is baſeneſs of ſpirit, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexive incongruity to vertue and honour; men of low principles can never level at high and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous actions, nor bear any ſymetry with thoſe of contrary tempers and affections; but if the minde be right, that beginning that was mean may reach a glorious and magnificent end.</p>

         <div n="51-100" type="pages">
            <p>Thirdly, perſons of different ſexes cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves for friendſhip according to our method, they muſt be either men or women, not a man and a woman, and that becauſe as their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are contrary, ſo is their condition, fancy &amp; buſineſs; nor can they rationally deſign, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual converſation without which Friendſhip is very imperfect, and but a lame attainment; nor can there be that familiar converſe and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy neceſſary to this concern, without reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if not temptations: ſhould I enter into this argument I might finde enough to ſay, but I judge it neither grateful nor expedient; Let thoſe that are concerned inform themſelves from the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that daily accrue upon ſuch adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; they need go no further then common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and obſervation to fatisfie their curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
            <p>The fourth inequality to be avoided, is, that of Religion, if there be a confluence of all other requiſites, and there be no harmony and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, here the Friendſhip will be ſhort lived: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing do more unite or divide perſons then Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if they agree in principles, religion won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:179860:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtrengthens the Frendſhip, and engages their hearts one towards another; and this muſt needs be ſo, for if men agree in things of the greateſt conſequence, it is likely they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in things leſs conſiderable: It is obſerved that no differences are ſo great as thoſe occaſioned by religion, and no ſpirits ſo bitter and inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as ſuch as are by diſputes in Religion exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: how hardly are ſmall diſſentings in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though but in one ſingle point, compoſed? what difficulty then muſt there needs be in redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thoſe to compliance that differ in ſubſtantial points, in the doctrine as well as in the manner of worſhip; and if this be not done, the Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will be uncertain. I grant, there may be ſome circumſtantial diſſenting among friends, and no great prejudice thereby, becauſe thoſe may be argued with indifference and moderation, and a reconciliation is not impoſſible, but very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe in this caſe the beſt reaſon carries it, but in ſubſtantial points the matter is not ſo ſoon done: Matter of Faith ſeems too ſacred to ſubmit to the beſt reaſon while conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unſatisfied, who though miſguided and led by examples and cuſtome that have no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the word of God the moſt infallible rule, yet theſe ſhall have ſuch influences upon the ſeduced conſcience, that they will not give place to the moſt infallible and divine truths, and having made the firſt impreſſion will pleade their propriety, and oppoſe it againſt the commands of divine juſtice: there is much arguing in this caſe, little yielding and compliance, when men
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:179860:30"/> are tainted with corrupt principles, arguing may beget diſguſts and heats, and ingage the paſſions, and ſet them all a quarrelling, and winde up the differences to ſuch heights as will admit of no pacifying arguments: this is plainly proved by common experience; witneſs the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Reformed Churches; what vaſt endeavours has there been for an accomodation, but with no ſucceſs; the animoſity grows higher, and a reconciliation more impoſſible, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the vaſt treaſures that have been expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and effuſion of bloud that hath been ſpilt, and is ſtill ſhedding: Look a little nearer, even among our ſelves, where the diſſentings are not ſo univerſal, and we ſhall finde much vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and trouble: Is it not obſervable, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have lived and converſed together a great while, have at laſt parted, and no cauſe viſible appearing; there ſeems to be a twofold reaſon for this, Firſt, from the difference in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which prevails ſo over the paſſions, that love the maſter-affection which for ſome time hath preſerved unity, has now changed its property, and by accident, occaſions the greateſt quarrel: had men no religion, they would not be ſo liable to diſſentions, there being no cauſe for diſpute; they were equal in ſuch a condition, I had almoſt ſaid equally unhappy, but it may be ſuppoſed, that prudence may do much to compoſe things, it may keep in the fire a while, but not long, it will at laſt break out into a flame: nothing more common then for men to be great friends, while neuters in religion, but if either come to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:179860:31"/> pious, they fall a quarrelling preſently, it is not the religion that doth it, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the one againſt the Religion of the other; if a man loves his friend, he cannot ſee him walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ways of death and not reprove him, and that ſmartly; and this cannot be born what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity can continue: where there can be no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without quarelling, no reproof without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting; now friends begin to treat one the other with ſuſpiſion and abſent themſelves from that equal converſation and intimacy which firſt made the amity and muſt ſtill preſerve it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the efficacy of piety and religion it ſelf inſenſibly looſens the knot of this alliance, becauſe the one cannot bear the convictions and reſtraints that will be laid on him by the other, which though not by deſigne, and intentially, but by example and accidentally, will be very ſevere and confining to his extravagant temper: I have read a ſtory of a young gallant, who had a pious Father, that had given him many admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but he little minding the counſel and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his father, became vilely vicious, and when he intended to drink to exceſs or be any other way debauched in the room where the effiges of his dead father hung, he would firſt draw a curtain before the picture, ſaying, he could not be frolick while he ſaw any thing of his father, who had ſo often reproved him; ſuch convictions attended him: I ſhall only add, that in all alliances, religion, if ſincere, is the ſureſt tie; nothing we enjoy can be conſtant and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without this: this is the fruit of the tree of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:179860:31"/> life, which if we feed on, will make our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts not onely long laſting, but our happineſs everlaſting.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the inequality of relations comes to be conſidered; but before I proceed, give me leave to take notice of an objection which ſeems ready to aſſault me at my firſt entrance into this part of the diſcourſe, and that is, that I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured all along to confine friendſhip, and limit it to a moral capacity and ſo have excluded relations which in truth, are more capable &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of it: there are three relations eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that make this challenge; Father and Son, Husband and Wife, and Brethren: Pray give me leave to leade theſe Objectors into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe relations, and there they will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themſelves of the invalidity of this ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did ſcruple, which is more in ſhew then in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>To begin with the firſt, namely, Father and Son, this relation is ſo far from equality, that it intends and commands the contrary, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of diſparity, which is ſo natural to the relation that it can neither have a being nor well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being without it: Inſtance, the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Father, which can never be leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the fear and duty of the Son, which cannot be excuſed: a father is much more bound in this relation then any other ſuperiour, for they may ſometimes diſpence with their propriety in this regard, without prejudice to themſelves, and with advantage to the inferiour, but a parent cannot abate any of his juſt authority, but with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:179860:32"/> injury both to himſelf and his ſon; to himſelf by failing in his duty, which is ever to keep up his power in all lawful things; to his ſon, in laying before him a temptation to diſobedience, by his example, while he omits his duty: Indulgence is the inlet to all other traps and ſnares: ſad Inſtances we have had of this in our preſent Age, where all vices are made almoſt indifferent, but ſuch as diſturb the tranquility of the Kingdom: there are many things of the nature of this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that cannot conſiſt with a moral Friendſhip: Inſtance, the power and command of the Father, the fear and obedience of the ſon, theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that perſonal equality, which cannot be exempted from Frendſhip; it being as natural to the being and well-being of that concern as ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality is to this of relations: the propereſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions between Friends is that which a Father and ſon never do, as conſtant, familiar converſe, equal converſation, wherein they always ſubmit their wills and affections each to other: there are many things in frendſhip that cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted where there is a challenge of duty and command: it is no prejudice to a parent, and the duty <hi>I</hi> owe him, to pay all poſſible endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to my Friend, becauſe there are many things due to the one, the other cannot challenge: It is not my deſigne to derogate from any relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that juſt eſteem they ought to have: this muſt be allowed, that this relation makes great dearneſs and a moſt inviolable Frendſhip, and under ſuch real obligations, as the laws of God and men hath made indiſpenſable, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:179860:32"/> there are duties that obliged them before any other Frendſhip could be made, and have left ſuch impreſſion as muſt abide, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give place to any other, becauſe of their propriety which is ſupreme: There are two things eſpecially I ſhall point at, wherein this relation differs from a moral Friendſhip, and that is, firſt, in their ſprings from whence they flow, and Secondly, in their ends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes: Firſt, the love and frendſhip of the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is grounded purely upon natural cauſes, and therefore called natural affection: there is no need of prudence in this caſe, no man conſults his reaſon, whether he ſhall love his ſon or not, a natural inſtinct inclines him to that, but if his ſon be rebellious, then he hath need of prudence to direct him how to regulate his affections, ſo is his indulgence may not prejudice his ſon: There are many things binding to perſons in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, as the original from whence the love of this relation comes is incongruous to that of Frendſhip, ſo their ends are contrary: Frendſhip deſignes nothing more then the pleaſure of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby by communicating each others joys and hopes, afflictions and diſappointments, they come to obtain the proper and moſt uſeful effects of Frendſhip, but parents have no ſuch expectation, they do not aim at a ſociable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in their children, nor children in their parents: how freely do parents and children con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be divided, ſometimes into the fartheſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:179860:34"/> part of the world, one from another; if their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, eſtates, or content may be advanced by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are very well ſatisfied, to meet once or twice in their whole lives, or to converſe together in a few lines, which are uncertainly ventured, and ſeldom arrive at the deſired place, and when they come can do no more but tell them they left a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation alive, but how long he hath continued ſo ſince is moſt uncertain: men account themſelves rich in relations, when their propriety is ſo far removed that they ſerve only for contemplation and generation, both which gives but a general no particular contentment; it is otherwiſe among friends, they cannot ſatisfie themſelves in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, fruition is that which compleats their felicity: Friends are like the turtles, they never aſſociate themſelves with other birds, they never ſing and fly abroad for recreation as other birds do, but they have their peculiar notes for each other, and when the one dies, the other droops till he dies; ſo friends, they need none of thoſe vanities that are remote, they never ſearch after them, the chatting of Friends is to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a moſt pleaſing note; they live in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of each other, and if one dies how impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently doth the other lament after him until he die alſo: So then it is plain by what has appeared in this argument, that this relation of Father and ſon hath not in it the capacity of a moral Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, how then can it have the ſignification of it?</p>
            <p>The Second Relation to be examined is Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, the former relation was grounded upon natural cauſes, but this upon
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:179860:34"/> juſtice and reaſon, purſuant to a ſolemn league and Covenant, which cannot be violated, but by the worſt perfidiouſneſs, and as the love of that relation was natural this is conjugal, and in ſome reſpect greater then natural affection, becauſe here are greater obligations and more binding duties annexed to this relation then to any other, and that by a twofold law, the law of God, and the law of man. I muſt expect to meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons that will think themſelves diſobliged by this argument, therefore I muſt ſay ſomething to fatisfie them: I muſt confeſs, I have leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this part of the diſcourſe, then in all the reſt; This relation by a groundleſs ſuppoſition has been deemed the beſt capacity for Frendſhip, as having in it ſelf all that accomodation neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Let us conſider the perſons, and then the relation, the perſons ſtrictly conſidered, are not fit for this concern, not only becauſe of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in ſexes, though that be ſomething, but upon many other material conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is the greateſt inequality poſſible in the perſons, and it is conſtituted by the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf; perſons may be equall before marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, they cannot be ſo afterwards: now what makes the change, only the relation, nothing elſe could do it; if a King gives his Crown and throne to a ſlave, it's no wonder if the ſlave poſſeſſes that throne and Crown, and he be degraded, but this is not ſo great a prejudice, as ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in marriages, for the ſlave is but an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and there is no law to confirm him in that undeſerved grandure but thoſe that make a like

               </gap> nature of Frendſhip, and ſuch as are moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, which cannot ſtand with this relation; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance they cannot ſubmit their judgments and wills one to another in all things, this Frendſhip muſt do or it cannot be, and this is expected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Frends which are equal, but not among thoſe that cannot be ſo: for a ſuperiour to ſubmit his judgment and will to an inferiour, is neither juſt nor convenient, but for the inferiour to ſubmit both to the ſuperiour, is juſt and neceſſary: it is true, there is command and duty in Frendſhip but thoſe that command, and them that obey are equal, and though they may ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand different things they have not different wills, but this cannot be, where command and duty is ſeverally in the perſons, becauſe where there is an abſolute power to command, there follows a proportionable obligation to obey as a juſt due that cannot be excuſed or omitted: and becauſe power is not alwaies ſo regular and juſt as it ought to be, therefore it is, that there is ſuch difference &amp; jarring among inferiors and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:179860:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> and this will ever be ſo long as men hath any thing of pride, or paſſion, and ſo they augment or leſſen their authority by theſe rules, and hereby ſometimes the ſtate of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is ſo imbittered that it becomes harſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, they will pleade the threatning, this deſire ſhall be to thy husband, and he ſhall rule over thee, and the laws of men are ſeldom favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this kinde, but impoſeth more upon it, as we finde by the civil law of Nations, which commands the man proving bankrupt and caſt into priſon, his wife be ſold, if ſhe be worth it to redeem her husband; and as if the bondage were not ſevere enough, the conſent of the wife comes in, and twiſts the cord, and makes it yet ſtronger; the woman is obliged by no law, till ſhe bindes her ſelf by a voluntary conſent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther law of God nor man doth conſtrain her to come under theſe reſtrictions, but finding her there lays more obligations upon her.</p>
            <p>2ly, let us examine the relation it ſelf (ſome ſay) that conveys Frendſhip, we will look into the firſt marriage, that in Paradiſe, if a perfect Frendſhip, can be conveyed by the relation, we ſhall finde there <hi>Adam</hi> had as much reaſon to contract a perfect frendſhip with <hi>Eve</hi> as any man ever had, ſhe being made of the body of <hi>Adam</hi> in a more peculiar maner then any elſe ever was, and becauſe ſhe was the gift of God immediatly delivered to <hi>Adam</hi> as a token of ſpecial favour, and becauſe there was no creature ſo ſuitable to him as ſhe was; and this ſimilitude was ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement from a natural principle that inclines
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:179860:36"/> every creature to love its like; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, we ſee that in <hi>Adam</hi> that ſeems contrary to Frendſhip in many things, eſpecially this, that he ſo readily and upbradingly laid tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> blame upon his wife, a true friend would have taken upon himſelf, ſo that there ſeems a want of Frendſhip in paradiſe, and this may very well be, paradiſe was not without its wants, man wanted a wife for generation, and why not a friend for counſel, advice, and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? had <hi>Eve</hi> had a faithful friend, who would have encouraged and ſtrengthned her againſt the inſinuations of the ſerpent, ſhe might have baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled his arguments, and repelled his ſtrongeſt temptations: on the other ſide, had <hi>Adam</hi> been ſo happy to have had a faithful monitor, in the <hi>intermi,</hi> when the temptation lay before him, he would not have ſo raſhly ventured upon the breach of that primitive and poſitive command, yet he had a greater advantage then the woman, in that he might have argued the point with the woman (with leſs ſurpriſe) then the woman could with the Serpent; he had the advantage of diſcourſe with her: he might have demanded of her, how ſhe could think to eſcape the penalty of ſo peremptory a law, and by what arguments ſhe was invited to the breach of ſo poſitive a command, and what advantage ſhe propounded to her ſelf in ſo bold and criminal an undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſuch arguing might have given ſome check to the temptation; much arguing there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the woman and the Serpent: where was <hi>Adam</hi> then? had there been Frendſhip <hi>Adam</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:179860:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> could not have been ſo long from <hi>Eve,</hi> being in the ſame garden with her, till the Serpent could accompliſh ſo great a work; this ſeems to be a work of time: neither is it likely, had there been this amity, that ſhe would have intended, much leſs have acted any thing, till ſhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Adam</hi> with it, with whom ſhe would have had inclination enough to adviſe with in ſuch a difficult caſe, there being always a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of affairs between friends: no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the woman was ſeduced when all the wit and policy of hell was imployed to do it: but <hi>Adam</hi> without that was betrayed, he haſtily ventures without reſervation and exception upon the breach of ſo poſitive a command.</p>
            <p>Again, if this relation could convey the beſt Frendſhip, none in that relation could miſs it, but experience evinces the contrary: we finde not ſeldom their open enmity; if the relation could convey it, though there was little love before marriage, there would be no want of it after, but this is clear to common obſervation, that where perſons have ventured into this relation before, the affection and fancy hath been fixed, the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been ſo far from engaging the affections and uniting the heart, that it hath encreaſed the enmity, and ſometimes to murther and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent acts; and I might bring many reaſons for this, but I do not love to rake in a kennel.</p>
            <p>Again, as repeated fruition is the moſt bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing among Friends, in this relation it is moſt looſening; I have heard ſome ſay, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to, that repeated fruition is a dull thing,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:179860:37"/> &amp; blunts the edge of the greateſt affection, Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in this relation would be arbitrary, and therefore it is that there are ſuch ſtrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands obliging perſons to the duties of it, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by the laws of God and man: It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that Frendſhip is moſt tied, and yet moſt free; there are no laws confining friends, they have no need of coaction to obedience, love is a law to it ſelf, this ſhews the natural unfixedneſs of the one and the ſtability of the other: ſome men were they left to their liberty as friends are, they would change their wives as often as they put off their clothes; men are much guided by humour and fancy, ſmall things deludes the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at one time, and things as contemptible will alter it at another; men haſtily catch at a wife, ſhe pleaſeth him well, after a little while fancy hath found out ſome new object, and then we hear them ſay, they cannot fancy the old, the new is better; but Frendſhip is ever guided by reaſon and judgment, and findes more amiableneſs and lovelineſs in the object every day: give me leave to adde, that perſons in this relation are not capable of thoſe convenient and neceſſary acts of kindeneſs that friends are, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in emergences of ſtate or times of war, a frend may be eminently uſeful in either, but what can a wife do, ſhe can have no vote in Council, nor command in war: The wife of <hi>David,</hi> though the daughter of <hi>Saul,</hi> and therefore did not want intereſt when he left the Court and betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the wars, ſignified little to him, but <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> his friend was more uſeful then then ever;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:179860:37"/> and this is moſt conſiderable, the advantage frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has beyond relations, for perſonal kindeneſs which comes to paſs from hence, becauſe they are united in heart though not in perſon in a legal ſenſe as men and their wives are; and this is no ſmall advantage, hereby they are more uſeful in times of extremity, where none will aſſiſt and help but them alone; many acts of frendſhip women are not capable of, if a husband be arreſted, his wife cannot bail him, but his friend can; if her teſtimony be never ſo full and pertinent, it will not be taken for her husband: I might inſtance in many other things, but I haſten from this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull argument.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If Frendſhip were made by this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then no man would ſeek it elſewhere, but we ſee thoſe perſons who have as much content as the relation can give ambition, this ſtate of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and they make the firmeſt and ſtrongeſt alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in this regard, and the reaſon they give is this, that they would finde ſatisfaction moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their nature and being, and that (ſay they) can be no where but among equals, where this only can be found, that the hearts are united and the perſons free to all friendly acts and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and this cannot be among relations, where the perſons are joyned, but too often the hearts are free: I hope none will miſtake and think I have no true value for this relation, I have really a great reſpect for this relation, and highly eſteem it where it is in truth rightly managed: They are moſt happy that meet with leaſt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments every one will conclude; poverty
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:179860:38"/> and ſickneſs what a change do they make, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this relation aim at many ends, which if they miſs they are impatient, and that becauſe there doth not ſeem efficacy enough in the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to command a ſubmiſſion to any great diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: And by how much the more evils cannot be foreſeen, by ſo much the more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable they be: I ſhall point at but one end and that is children, if they fail of this end, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do, what an alienation doth this make, or rather a ſeparation: I am loth to ſay, it is plain enough, but friends can miſs their ends in many th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngs without diſtraction, croſſes doth not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them, but rather unite them: <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were never ſo united as then when afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeized them, then it was that they renewed their covenant and ſtrengthned their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons one towards another: Thus I have led you through two relations, the one ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the principles of nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore binding, the other upon a promiſe or covenant no leſs obliging, &amp; to both theſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is due, but not that friendſhip or love I am treating of; there is natural affection due to the one and a conjugal love due to the other, which muſt be paid with all care and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>I ſhall touch a little briefly upon the third rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo come to what I moſt aim at.</p>
            <p>The Third Relation I am to ſpeak to is, that of Brethren; I ſhall conſider the perſons and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation jointly; brethren having in them all that worthineſs that friendſhip requires, are the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:179860:38"/> ſubjects for friendſhip, but they do not paſs into it upon the account of relation, nature paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes but little, but as they are diſpoſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, either by natural qualities or moral excellencies: We ſee brothers that live apart, and adopt themſelves to Families remote, they have little love: Frendſhip is nouriſhed by the ſame matter by which it was firſt made, it was created by communion and fellowſhip in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual converſation, and muſt live by the ſame: the Wiſe man obſerved, that in a time of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration frendſhip was of a ſmall ſignification: <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a neighbour near then a brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off;</hi> and he draws his argument from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of the one, and the capacity of the other; for all friendly acts &amp; intercourſes, its true frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may laſt, when by ſome accident the perſons are divided, but not in that vigour it did before: it is a languiſhing friendſhip; we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this by the ſimilitude of the love of the iron the loadſtone, which ariſeth from a hidden quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the motion of the iron towards the loadſtone is ſlow while at a diſtance, but quick when near, and when it doth but touch it, it cleaves ſo faſt, that unleſs forced, 'twill never part, and when it is parted 'twill at the furtheſt part of the world retain the vertue of the touch; ſo Friends while at a diſtance move ſlowly, but when together are ſo united, that they cannot be ſeparated without great force and violence, and their ſeparation is like the dividing the heart from the body: now that there is nothing in the bare relation that can amount to friendſhip, will be further evident by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:179860:39"/> our daily experience, which furniſheth us with inſtances of the great animoſities among brethren, and ſuch averſions as cannot conſiſt with friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: Look into the family of <hi>Adam,</hi> and there you ſee murther; into the Family of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> you would think you ſhould not miſs of kindeneſs there, yet inſtead thereof we finde <hi>Eſau</hi> conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himſelf how he ſhould ſlay his brother: this is moſt true, that there may be much indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red affection between brethren, occaſioned by the equalneſs of their perſons and converſation, they having in them all other requiſites, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> firſt to be choſen as the moſt fit perſons for friendſhip, the relation being ſomething, and when both theſe meet the relation and frendſhip, they exemplifie one the other, and ſhine moſt illuſtriouſly; but ſome may think, I have purſued this ſubject too far, I am ſure it was with no deſigne to derogate from the juſt deſert due to any relation, yet I would not have them monopolize our eſteem, ſo as to ſnuffle out Frendſhip, which ſo truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our value.</p>
            <p>I come now to the qualifications which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to a well grounded frendſhip: all that <hi>I</hi> have ſaid hitherto is previous to what remains: <hi>I</hi> hope none will expect frendſhip in an artificial dreſs, attended with elegant phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and words well accented, this being both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove my ability, and far wide of my deſigne, which is a general ſatisfaction in this materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al concern, in the plaineſt way that <hi>I</hi> can; gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing and gaudy embelliſhments being trivial accompliſhments where truth is concerned, which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:179860:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhines bright enough without them.</p>
            <p>The Firſt qualification is this, there muſt be an intire affection and love among friends, this is the principal hindge upon which this concern turns, this being a philoſophical diſcourſe it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to touch upon love in general. Love in the general nature of it is either rational and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, or ſenſual and ſubordinate, in the ſirſt ſence love is the moſt vigorous, potent, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, affectionate; it ſits as Queen Regent in the will, and governs all the faculties; love is the ſpring of humane actions, and gives life, being, and motion to them all; the other affections, as deſire, hope, joy, fear, anger, all theſe are but the ſeveral forms and ſhapes oſ love; for as the object of love is affected with this or that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo is love proportionably inveſted with this or that form; if the object be abſent, love goes out to meet it in deſire, if preſent, it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laceth it ſelf in fruition and delight; if under dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and hazard, love trembleth with fear: if it be impeded or hindred, love waxeth angry and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, when there is any poſſibility of enjoying the object: love moves nimbly after it if impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of enjoyment; ſo that the object be loſt, love clothes it ſelf in mourning habit: there is alſo a kinde of love in the ſenſual and animal part, but this is more paſſionate, that in the ſuperiour part more rational; this is more uncertain, that more fixed; this more confuſed, that more regular and uniform.</p>
            <p>There is a threefold love,</p>
            <p>Firſt Divine, and that is altogether ſpiritual
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:179860:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> and highly rational.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a natural love, and that may be bruitiſn as well as rational.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is a moral love, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a mean betwixt both, evermore the thing beloved gives the denomination to love; if the object be divine, it is a divine love; if ſenſual, it is a bruitiſh love; if moral, it is a moral love.</p>
            <p>Love is an affection of union whereby we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and enjoy perpetual union with the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and there are theſe two effects that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly flow from this union: Firſt, it is transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and changing by love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are changed into a thing more noble or more vile; ſo that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe our ſelves when we love any unworthy and inferiour thing, whatever we love we give a kinde of dominion over us, ſo that the will lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its dignity when it loves abject things.</p>
            <p>Again, Love inlarges and widens the heart, not only for the reception of the bounty and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the object, but the object it ſelf is that the heart goes out after when the will is filled with love, it awakens all the powers, and moves all the faculties towards the object, the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meditates and is enquiring after the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the thing beloved, ſtill muſing and plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about it; the will is obſtinate and will not be charmed of its object; the thoughts they are ſtill kindling the affections who are in eager purſuit after the thing beloved, but <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſpeak more particularly to this matter, and explain my meaning in this particularly. My meaning is, that there muſt be an intire love not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:179860:40"/> only to the qualities of the minde, though thoſe be moſt worthy, but this love muſt reach the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the body, if that be ungrateful there cannot be a complacential Frendſhip; As the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour part muſt have Analogy to reaſon, ſo the external part muſt be accommodated to the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: in ſhort, there muſt not be conceived in the ſancy a diſguſt againſt the form and condition of the perſon, all love begins with the perſon, if that be diſpleaſing and ungrateful, nothing will ſatisfie, there is that in the perſon of every man that either obligeth or diſobligeth the fancy: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there may be ſome perſonal defects which are ſo natural, that they cannot be divided from the perſon, and theſe may be very diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; or there may be ſome croſs diſpoſitions, &amp; they may be ſo riveted by cuſtome, that they will hardly (if ever) be cured; Love ſtudies the perſon in the firſt place, and it is moſt neceſſary, becauſe as there is a kinde of antipathy in ſome perſons to ſome creatures, ſo that they cannot be brought to take any pleaſure in them, ſo many times we ſee an antipathy in men againſt ſuch particular perſons; there is no more reaſon to be given for the latter then the former, yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety is as evident in the one as the other, and this may be occaſioned by the miſtake of fancy, rather then any real defect in the object; the eye of fancy may be ſo vitiated, that it may not be able to behold the clearneſſe of a ſplendid object with complacency and delight, a weak eye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look with content upon a clear air, much leſſe can it behold the ſun, there is ſuch a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:179860:41"/> in them; ſo that we often draw a curtain between them as a ſcreen or veil, not that the air or ſun are not both excellent in themſelves but the reaſon why they are not deſirable, is the eye is not receptive of them, becauſe of its own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility and weakneſſe: fancy is often ſurpriſed in the firſt choice and election, ſometimes it's blinde, and declines objects moſt worthy, and purſues thoſe that are moſt baſe and abject, it ſeldom conſults reaſon, but often betrays it; ſpacious objects convey themſelves through the fancy to the will; the ſenſes they inveagle the fancy, and the fancy betrays and captivates the will: Fancy othertimes is ſo idle that it will not take the pains to examine things but is put off with outward gaudineſs, it ſeldome is ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect to act by rule, and that is the reaſon we are ſo uncertain in our firſt elections of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things: Fancy raſhly fixeth without the conſent of reaſon, to which it ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient, rather complying with ſence, which makes it ſtray and warp from the exact rule; it is very hard to ſecure the fancy which lies open to ſo many temptations; and if it be betrayed and deluded, it is as hard to reclaim it: <hi>I</hi> have thought that paſſage in <hi>Samuel</hi> worth obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he was ſent to anoint <hi>David, Eliab</hi> the elder brother paſſed before him, he fancies him preſently, becauſe he was a comely perſon: we experience this among our ſelves, when we come into a room where we ſee many ſtrange faces, we take an affection to one more then the reſt: <hi>Jonathans</hi> heart was knit to <hi>David,</hi> while he was
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:179860:41"/> diſcourſing with <hi>Saul,</hi> and he loved him as his own foul: there is no reaſon to be given why a man ſhould pitch upon one perſon with delight without the leaſt concern for the reſt, but this fancy is ſurprized, and that ſo ſtrangely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that reaſon cannot prevail to break thoſe fetters the man is manacled with haply to his great prejudice and utter ruine.</p>
            <p>As there are ſeveral things that may betray and delude the fancy, ſo there are things that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe it, that may be removed as a ſupercilious gravity, this is very ungrateful, yet may not be ſo rivited as never to be taken away, as a harſh and ſevere aſpect, and the like: but thoſe things that cannot be divided from the perſon muſt (though never ſo ungrateful in themſelves) be kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted: that which ſeems deformity to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which ſtands at a diſtance to the object, may appear pleaſant to me who am more united, and therefore I may ſee comelineſs where they fancy nothing but the contrary: this being the prudence of friendſhip to reconcile it ſelf to every thing that at the firſt view may ſeem not grateful; if this cannot be done fancy is ſtill uneaſy; where there is a latitude, every faculty will endeavour a ſatisfaction; fancy bears ſo great a ſway in all matters of Love and friendſhip, that it will be humored and that in the firſt place, and the rather becauſe it ſtands nearer then any other faculty to that object about which it is converſant, it is ſo conſiderable, that nothing can be done without it. So there are many things very pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the fancy, if it be rightly guided, as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:179860:42"/> an humble demonier, a ſweet and amiable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: the wiſe-man obſerved, that <hi>the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a man rejoyceth his friend,</hi> if I cannot look upon my friend with delight I cannot love him, looking breeds liking, and proves the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to affection: <hi>Jonathan</hi> embraced the perſon of <hi>David;</hi> very pleaſant was <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> his love paſſed the love of the moſt paſſionate woman.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as we muſt love the perſon of our friend, ſo we muſt love his conditions, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love his perſon and hate his conditions, this is a paradox, and altogether impoſſible: I do not ſay, but we may and muſt love the perſons of our enemies, though we muſt hate and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their conditions, if they be evil; but this is with a love of charity, it cannot be with a complacential love; what felicity can a vertuous man take in a vicious perſon, he may love him ſo as to pitty and pardon, and converſe with him at diſtance, but never ſo as to court his ſociety, and place him in his boſome, it may be my friend is not the moſt affable courteous and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, or the patienteſt, or the beſt humoured man in the world, yet I may love him; one worthy quality is enough to make friendſhip, but the more worthy the greater the reaſon: a friend muſt endeavour a reconciliation to the condition of his friend as well as his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as far as poſſible, and throw the mantle of love over thoſe defects that are either acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or ſuch as are not ſo riveted that they cannot by contrary examples and friendly arguments be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:179860:42"/> expunged: inſtance, a paſſionate man may ſee ſo much ſweetneſs in patience that he may abhor contention, and ſo much pleaſure in a free and equal converſation, that he may hate reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo much grace and beauty in humility, that pride may be caſt out as moſt contemptible: reaſon will mightily prevail with ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this regard, and they may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of theſe vanities which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with Frendſhip: love cannot be ſupported but by that which is ſubſtantial, and this muſt be allowed, that there are ſome diſpoſitions that cannot comport themſelves for Frendſhip: there are diſpoſitions or rather evil qualities that I could never be reconciled to, and they are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially four, covetouſneſs, and deep melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pride and envy; I couple them together as thoſe tyrants which aim at a perfect conqueſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the heart, and life, theſe can never ſtand with this relation and ſtate of Frendſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are diametrically contrary, and the only poyſon that corrupt and deſtroy it,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> ingroſſes the whole heart, and will endure nothing in the leaſt contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Covetouſneſs ſo debaſes the heart, that no noble quality can inhabite there; it bends and ſubmits all to the mettal it ſo dearly loves and ſo highly values, and that is thick clay. Reaſon, conſcience, and affection are all entangled in this golden web, ſo that they cannot ſoare aloft ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fix upon, or contemplate thoſe things that ennable a man, and makes him act like himſelf according to his moral excellencies and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:179860:43"/> of the ſoul. A covetous man will lay all things at ſtake, rather than his mony; his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, life, ſoul, any thing ſhall go; ſee this in <hi>Gehezi</hi> and in <hi>Demas,</hi> the one imbraced a lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, rather than looſe a talent; the other forſook God to imbrace this preſent world. Have we not inſtances of this before our eyes every day, when we ſee men lay their honour in the duſt, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice life, content and every thing to this dumb Idol; that man that loves mony more than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or God, muſt needs love it better than his friend, and therefore above all perſons fit to be excluded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>melancholy</hi> in the extremity of it comes next to be examined, and this always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the former; that fills the heart with diſtracting cares, vehement deſires, which if croſſed, preſently this is ready, as an effect of that cauſe; as appears in wicked <hi>Haman;</hi> he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted not only riches but honour, as moſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men do; though they never do a generous act to deſerve it; and becauſe he could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it from <hi>Mordecai</hi> an inconſiderable perſon in his eſteem, he preſently falls into a fit of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and though he had more to boaſt of then moſt men in reſpect of his honour, riches, and favour with the King, yet all this ſignified nothing, as long as <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſtood in the kings gate, who refuſed that obeiſance to <hi>Haman,</hi> he ſo eagerly coveted, and ſo impartiently pined after, and hereupon the devil deludes him, and helps him to hammer out this device in his own ſhop, (which is melancholy) to hang <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:179860:43"/> This was the anvil <hi>Haman</hi> had been working at before, when he had framed an engine to deſtroy all the Jews. I cannot find any ill quality exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from melancholy, as wrath, malice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, uncharitableneſs, miſ-truſt, ſelf-love in the higheſt degree, and where all theſe are, we may juſtly conclude there cannot be frendſhip: they love nothing but themſelves, they indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they admire themſelves, as if God had created them for no other purpoſe, or to any other end; and ſo extream wilful are they, if they will their own deſtruction, they will effect it, they are naturally the greateſt cowards in the world, and they cannot be otherwiſe, except carried out by ſome violent motion, as pride, jealouſie, covetouſneſs, or malice; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will lay violent hands upon themſelves, and this they call reſolution, but it is the cowardlyeſt act poſſible to come upon nature when it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and deſtroy it, when by ſtarving or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent nature is brought low, to lay violent hands upon it this cannot be valour. I dread nothing more than this pettiſh humour and diſpoſition; I could never make friendſhip with a perſon who in all reſpects <hi>I</hi> might believe would be as prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of my life, ſhould <hi>I</hi> truſt it with him as of his own. Many Examples we have of this daily, and much blood hath been ſhed by melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that often harbours ſuch diſcontents, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but blood can ſatisfy, and not ſeldom the blood of thoſe they have moſt reaſon to preſerve; <hi>Judas</hi> was ſuch a one, who through covetouſnes firſt betrayed his maſter, and after through me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:179860:44"/> hanged himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us conſider the other couple pride and envy. A proud man cannot be a true friend becauſe he cannot deny himſelf, in any reſpect: He wholy aimes at himſelf in his thoughs, words, and actions; his honour, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, eaſe is all he looks after; he is not ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous how it fares with others: He will be a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes</hi> and have the preheminence: he cannot give place: himſelf is his end, and his will is his rule, by which he ſquares all his actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Law he endeavours paſſionately to bring all others unto ſubjection to, at leaſt all thoſe that are under his power and juriſdiction: like <hi>Haman</hi> he will rather loſe his life, then abate any thing of his pride, is contentious and clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and cannot ſtand with friendſhip. <hi>Iehu</hi>-like he carries on all his deſignes: he is well learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the art of multiplication and addition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a novice in the rule of ſubſtraction, except from others to himſelf. Pride is an unbecoming garment, let it be never ſo ſplendid in ſhew, it is but a fools coate: a proud man is ſtill build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his own reputation with the ruine of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he thinks himſelf always degraded when another is valued; and whatſoever is attributed unto another, though never ſo juſt, he thinks it a wrong done to him: he would willingly ingroſſe all the applauſe unto himſelf, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appear in any generous action to deſerve it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cares not who loſes, ſo that he may gain: he will rather rob God himſelf, as <hi>Herod</hi> did, then deny applauſe: he will blaze abroad any thing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:179860:44"/> that hath but the appearance of good, but will ſeldom or never do any praiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worthy act: upon an adreſs to him, let the complaint be never ſo juſt, and the adreſſe never ſo humble, and the object never ſo deprorable, he is no way affected, but like <hi>Nabal</hi> a man cannot ſpeake to him: he covets to be admired by all, but obliges none: feared he may be, but never loved: this man may promiſe fair, but he is ſo uncertain, you cannot truſt him: by all which it is clear that a proud man cannot be fit for frendſhip, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all the contrary diſpoſitions, and muſt poſſefs them, or cannot be at all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let us conſider a little of Envy. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith, make no frendſhip with an angry man, and with the envious thou ſhalt not go: and here (that I may not be mifunderſtood,) we muſt diſtinguiſh of anger. I do not mean by anger here, the boiling of the blood, which comes from a natural cauſe, this is like a flaſh of lightning, ſoon come and ſoon gone: This is found to be the conſequence of the beſt diſpoſition; but I mean by this anger, that which ariſeth from an envious heart, that cannot ſleep except they have done miſchief. Theſe are like thunderclaps ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wounding to the very heart, and bears down all before it. <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved this, who can ſtand (ſaith he) before envy. Such have thoſe things in their hearts, and practiſes that cannot poſſibly abide with frendſhip, but would immediately, like a worm, eat out the ſubſtance of it. This anger or rather revenge reſts in the boſome of theſe fools: It is not a wayfaring man
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:179860:45"/> that continues for a night, but an inhabitant that is always at home plotting and contriving how to tread down credit, eſtate, life, and all, if it ſtand in its way. An envious man hath theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, he is ſoon diſobliged, never reconciled. He can forgive (he will ſay) but never forget: he is conſtant in nothing but vexation: his tongue a perſecutor: his heart like the troubled waters, caſting up nothing but mire and durt: Such a one was <hi>Simei,</hi> his revenge to his ſervant was ſo great, that he muſt follow him with the peril of his own life. You know what <hi>Simei</hi> was, by his railing at <hi>David:</hi> doubtleſs he was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and a malicious man: he that will prefer his paſſion before his own life, will hardly value the life of his friend. The calm temper is the beſt accommodated for frendſhip: <hi>how much better is a handful of green herbs, where quietneſs is, then a ſtalled oxe with ſtrife.</hi> A malitious man cannot be grateful; he is ſatisfyed with nothing: if a man be good he grudges that; if he be evil he will revile him, though he be worſe abundantly himſelf: he is like the witches, that put on their eyes when they went abroad, but when they came home, they put them in their pockets: if he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies an undervalue, he will hate a man for that, and he will never be ſerious about the cauſe of that hatred, but pronounce judgment right or wrong upon the perſon offending (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,) he will diſpence with all manner of juſtice in this caſe: he will do as <hi>Felix</hi> did by <hi>Paul,</hi> may be, promiſe a hearing at a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſeaſon, but that ſeaſon ſhall never come,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:179860:45"/> he having much more pleaſure in aggravating quarrels, then ſtudying peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond qualification is ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in converſation and expreſſion. There muſt be an agreement here, or elſe no amity, and herein is moſt of the ſweetneſs of frendſhip; can two walk together except they are agreed? walking ſignifies all manner of familiar converſe, and ſociable delight, and this is very pleaſant: I would rather have a friend that could delight me, than one that could enrich me: there is a vaſt content in the converſation of friends, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their communications, recreations, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations. In converſation we expreſs thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments and affections that feed a real frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; in communicating our joys and griefs, the firſt is doubled, the laſt is divided: with how much ſatisfaction do friends chat away ſad times, that otherwiſe would ſeem tedious, either by diſappointments or actual ſufferings; not ſeldom they diſcourſe themſelves out of a pettiſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, changing diſtracting thoughts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded reſolutions, for a calm and ſerious temper, and this may be done by ſolid and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arguments, wherein there is not only profit but beauty. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>a word ſpoken in ſeaſon</hi> how good is it? <hi>It is like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver;</hi> friends they have much variety of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to communicate, as their fears, and doubts, perfections, and imperfections; their hopes, and delights, eſpecially their affections, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of frendſhip which is often renewed. There muſt be this intercourſe between frends to avoid
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:179860:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſuſpition if they will be happy; and this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding neceſſary, becauſe fear offers violence to nature, takes away mans ſtrength, draws a cloud upon all his comforts, and lies like a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of lead upon the heart, we are moſt times more unhappy in what we fear, then in what we feel: How did <hi>Belſhazars knees ſmite one againſt another, and his very joynts were looſed when the hand-writing appeared upon the wall?</hi> Is it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſo with the beſt of us, when God writes bitter things againſt us? a friend in this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of affairs comes like the ſhepherds with tidings of great joy, &amp; declares our peace with God, his good will towards us. Theſe are the heart-cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arguments, that winds up the heart above thoſe fears, and like the ſun diſſipates the clouds, and opens a door of hope: fear overwhelms a man, caſts him into a ſwouning fit: a gracious and ſerious friend revives and reſtores him to his ſtrength again. Doubts are as inſeparable to men in their moſt ſerene temper, as motes from the air in the cleareſt day, or ſpots from the moon in the brighteſt night; there is much cauſe of heſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in men of the pureſt and moſt innocent conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, they are not without their entanglements, many a perplexing web they ſpin; but theſe may be unravelled by a judicious friend, who happily may be skilful, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was to anſwer thoſe riddles of providence, and reſolve thoſe doubts that at preſent ſeems intricate, and paſt finding out. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was ſuch a friend to the chief butler: men are many times reaſoned off their doubts, and inforced to throw them away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:179860:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> they cannot abide the teſt and conviction of reaſon. <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> the beſt friends we ever read of, they ſpent much time in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating their diſpondences and trouble. Saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, there is but a ſtep betwixt me and death:</hi> how affectionately did <hi>Ionathan</hi> reſolve this doubt; who alone was the moſt likely inſtrument to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>David:</hi> which he did, more then promiſe, in his anſwer to <hi>Davids</hi> ſcruple, where he ſaith, <hi>whatever thy ſoul deſires, I will do it for thee,</hi> and ſo goes on with pregnant arguments of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to <hi>David,</hi> whereby he cleared the moſt puzling doubt of all by expreſſing his care and kindneſs in a matter that concerned <hi>Davids</hi> life: the preſerving of which muſt looſe <hi>Ionathan</hi> his crown. <hi>Ionathan</hi> lying under this temptation, no wonder if <hi>David</hi> had doubts in ſuch times as theſe are; friends muſt renew their covenants, as they did, and acquieſce in the faithfulneſs of each other.</p>
            <p>Again, friends communicate their Joys and hopes; joy will ſtrengthen nature as effectually as fear will impair it: he is no friend that will not be more ready to impart his comforts then his ſorrows, which he may do with more freedom &amp; leſs caution, and may promiſe himſelf a mutual ſatisfaction, which doubles the content. There are many things that cheers the heart, but theſe being according to the conditions of the perſon concerned we cannot well define them, but this in the general obſerve, that whatever is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, earneſtly expected, juſtly due, if accompliſhed is a matter of joy &amp; delight, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:179860:47"/> cannot faithfully be concealed; whatever my friend takes pleaſure in, I muſt not withhold but rather augment, illuſtrate and amplify it, always annexing a complacent behaviour, as the ſitteſt temper for that ſeaſon, when the heart is upon the wing of hope &amp; joy, that will raiſe the ſocial communication of friends to a high pitch of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; when the heart is full of pleaſure, it is full of love, and reſolution; theſe being as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to joy and hope, as diſcontent and harſhnes is to fear and doubt: a merry heart makes a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countenance: what is more pleaſing then a cheerful aſpect? hope is to the ſoul as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor is to the ſhip: it keeps it ſteady among the moſt perplexing waves: Joy is a paſſion ariſing from the apprehenſion of ſome good we have in hand or in hope, relating to our ſelves or others: did I apprehend any thing in my ſelf, in the world or in my friend that could be matter of pleaſure unto him, I could be neither kind nor civil to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it, nor could any thing be matter of joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me if I could not impart it, at beſt it would be but a half joy.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, love and delight muſt be imparted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in this equal converſation: love is the hand within the wheel which turns the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; as the heart muſt not be without the habits of an intire affection, ſo our converſation muſt not be without the acts in our daily commerce: Love is workful and watchful: this paſſion is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry induſtrious, it's never off from action, nor doth it ever want expreſſion: It ſhrinks at neither ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice nor ſuffering: it is oyl to the wheel of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:179860:47"/> It thinks no ſuffering intolerable ſo long as it enjoys the help of a true friend, who will take up the heavyeſt end of the burthen, putting oyle into the wound, and joy into the heart by chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring conſiderations. In afflictions (ſayth <hi>Job</hi>) pitty ſhould be ſhewed by a friend. This is the diſcriminating time; a friend is known in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. If a man can delight in his friend when under a cloud, when his luſtre is obſcured (this ſpeaks a faſt friend) and adminiſters great delight: we do not much value our entertainment in a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate, all will admire the riſing ſun, but to have an equal reſpect when declining this is rare, and can proceed from nothing, but an unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affection, which excellently improves all opportunities and ſeaſons to expreſſe that love and delight which is conſonant unto it ſelf: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſweet then endeared expreſſions, theſe leave a tincture upon the heart many days after. How do we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owle ſuch expreſſions in our thoughts as hony under our tongue. Love is full of contemplation and invention, and therefore cannot be wanting in expreſſion.</p>
            <p>Suitableneſſe in recreation and buſineſſe in the world is alſo conſiderable as that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats the happineſs of this concern exceedingly; if friends differ here, much of their ſociety will be loſt. Inſtance, one man affects ſerious recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, another thoſe that are moſt ſenſual; theſe cannot hold correſpondency one with another long, but muſt certainly one time or another ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a breach, becauſe that their recreations are not only different but diametrically contrary, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:179860:48"/> conſequently will occaſion diſcontent on both ſides. A ſerious man though he may bear while he thinks there is ſome hopes of reclaiming, yet he cannot alwaies do it becauſe contrary to his reaſon, affection and humour, nor can he long ſuſpend his cenſures; on the other ſide pleaſure will ſo prevail with him that loves it that he will defend it, and contemn reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion too, if it ſtand in oppoſition to, or in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with it, pleaſure being very attractive and prevailing, nothing more.</p>
            <p>Let your buſineſs as much as poſſible be the ſame, at leaſt nor contrary; much of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Friendſhip ſtands in living, walking, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king together; there is nothing a man is more impatient of then the abſence of his friend: O how he longs for his communion! as the laſt ſweetens and ſhortens time, ſo the firſt imbitters it and makes it tedious; the reaſon is ready, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing ſo harſh as diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, eſpecially in thoſe things wherein we expect the higheſt ſatisfaction and pleaſure; ſuitable to mens negotiations ſuch are their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and affections; If a mans buſineſſe carry him far away, ſo that he ſtands at a great diſtance to the object, you will ſoon ſee coldneſſe in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, careleſneſſe and unconcernedeeſſe will follow immediatly; and as clouds will darken the ſplendour of Frendſhip, though it ſhined ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo bright before, and that becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be capable of thoſe acts of kindeneſſe which beautifies and maintains Frendſhip: beſides they meet with many diverſions and temptations,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:179860:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> which like a moth will ſoon deface the beauty and glory of this concern.</p>
            <p>There muſt be ſuitableneſſe in the expreſſion of our love; we muſt not obſerve different me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in the expreſſing of our affections: there is more in this then at the firſt view doth appear or we think of: the want of this hath occaſioned much difference among Friends, and created ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſleſs ſuſpicions, when their manner of expreſſions hath been contrary: Inſtance, ſome are more open and free, others more cloſe and reſerved; the firſt cannot believe any temper ſo contrary to generoſity, can haveany conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with Frendſhip; the latter ſuſpects the former, as altogether appearing in hyperboles, thinking that they riſe to high in their expreſſion to be real and ſo cenſure and ſlight it, though it be never ſo ingenious and certain. But when that method is the ſame, how confirmed and fixed is the frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and this is not hard to be brought to paſſe among prudent perſons, which though at the firſt they ſeem very different, yet they will ſoon agree: if they argue the caſe, and yield on both ſides to that which comes neareſt the rules of a perfect friendſhip in that latitude in which it ought to be conſidered, I think this would be one of the firſt things I would ſtudy, were I to contract a well grounded friendſhip. I never affected hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in friendſhip; though ſome ſay in love they are moſt comely; becauſe by the ſame reaſon I may not believe ſome, I may queſtion all that is expreſſed by them. A true expreſſion is moſt pleaſing and inſinuating: ſome truths may be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:179860:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> more valued than others; not that there is any defect in truth, but there may be in them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it. We value all truths, but eſpecially thoſe we beſt underſtand, and is of greateſt uſe unto us. Some truths may be ſo high that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach them: others may be ſo contrary to ſome tempers that they will not believe them, and hereby truth paſſes under a notion of falſhood, men are hardly brought to believe that in others which they cannot finde in themſelves; never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon their own incapacity for it, becauſe that were a ſecret reproof, and a cloſe reflexion, and therefore are more prone to conclude things impoſſible they cannot poſſeſſe, then prize or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue them in another. Neither would I be too low in my expreſſions; this were coming as ſhort as the other was ſhooting beyond the mark; becauſe high affections are alwaies accompanied with proportionable expreſſions. Nor could any thing mean be accepted; where there are ſuch vaſt expectations, as in friendſhip; but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may ſo regulate this affair, that neither demonſtration nor expreſſion, confirmation nor affection ſhall be wanting; as alſo bend all things to the perfect rule, ſo as there ſhall appear ſo much equality as ſhall reach and continue a real ſatisfaction and a right underſtanding of all things that at firſt ſeemed to render this ſameneſs in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion impoſſible or at leaſt uneaſy.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, above all diſparity be careful of this, that there be ſome proportion in your eſtates; covet not a perſon much richer than your ſelf to make a friend of: you may run into more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:179860:49"/> then you are aware of in this reſpect; ſutableneſs here is as conſiderable as in any of the former: I would not aim at an advantage here, becauſe as I would not have a friend that could not do me courteſies, ſo I would not have too great a dependance upon him: it is a more bleſſed thing to give, than to receive. I would rather take a friend that ſhould ſhare with me, then one that ſhould think my affection a purchaſe he made by his money. If you fancy a friend that is rich, or rather for his riches, ſit down firſt and conſider the charge; this may coſt you more than it is worth: we muſt be very diſcreet in this caſe, men cannot long love chargeable things: ſuch perſons may expect too much diſtance, obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſervice to ſtand with this relation: you muſt wiſely weigh all circumſtances, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend too much, if you intend to be happy: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney will beat down the price of friendſhip and contend for ſuperiority; and will think it very hard to be denyed when the leaſt reaſon of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge appears, we know, it is too baſe to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with friendſhip, yet it would be honoured becauſe it has a ſplendidaſpect, it carries its value in its face, &amp; like an uſurper endeavours to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſlavery &amp; contempt, that which is infinitely more valuable; true it is a vertuous man may be outwardly mean and contemptible, yet hath a minde more glorious than the gold that periſheth. I cannot but ſmile when I ſee perſons valued for their money, and they take very kindely, that which would be a vexation to me, which is, to ſee my ſervant honoured above my ſelf. How
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:179860:50"/> contemptible would many be, (though they make a great noiſe in the world, and are cloathed in gorgeous apparel) if their golden ſervant were gone, that they are adored for: ſuch a man would be deſpiſed though he be now like <hi>Dives,</hi> as <hi>Lazarus</hi> upon the dunghill, there is no real worth in gold, all is but fancy: there is more worth in a peece of bread, or in a draught of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then in all the ſilver and gold in both the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> Heathens could ſee this.</p>
            <p>We read of the <hi>Medes</hi> that they did not care for ſilver, and for gold they had no delight in it; It is hardly to be creditted how wiſe men do adore this dumb Idol, and value themſelves by it, ſtripping themſelves of robes and clothing themſelves with rags, I mean when they debaſe their reaſon which is the crop and glory of man in his moral capacity, and cloathe themſelves with thick clay, I could never honor nor eſteem a worthleſſe man, though I ſaw him tumble in gold, no more than I could value a puppet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had glittering attire. I cannot admire perſons, as they admire themſelves if their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt excellency be riches, and are only happy that they have what their mony can procure, making a hundred things neceſſary to themſelves, men of real worth could live and be happy without. I will never make a friendſhip with one that muſt maintain me: it is ten to one if ever I ſhould be brought to ſet ſo high a value upon an eſtate, as thoſe whoſe property it is would expect, if all the gold &amp; ſilver in the world were put into one ſcale and a vertuous man in the other, the latter would
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:179860:50"/> mightily overballance. I will bleſs God for plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but abundance I would be afraid of; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore remember what we are taught in our Litany to pray, which is, <hi>in time of our wealth, good Lord deliver us.</hi> If money were as little valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as vertue, and a greater price put upon good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we might yet live to ſee ſome happy days. There is nothing more contemptible than thoſe that look no higher then money; they cannot be honeſt, they will make ſhipwrack of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to get it, nor are they deſirable, becauſe ſo low in their ends and aims, that they do not think it worth their while to drive any other trade, but their profit: they will not be rational for fear they ſhould not be rich; they cannot look off from their wealth, nor ſtudy any other miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Theſe perſons will never be at the charge of frendſhip: all your endeavour there will be like water ſpilt upon the ground, that can never be gathered up again, no ſuitable returns can be expected.</p>
            <p>The third qualification, is ſelf-denyall: this is moſt neceſſary in frendſhip: friends muſt not be wilful; there may be ſeaſons when they cannot deſerve that name, if they cannot deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Jonathan</hi> denied himſelf eminently for <hi>David,</hi> they were both obliging, but <hi>Ionathan</hi> exceeded, becauſe though he knew <hi>David</hi> would prove a ſupplanter, yet he conſulted how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him, hazarding the loſſe of his crown and kingdom. A man will in ſome reſpects do more for his friend than himſelf, in a way of ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: many men would be reduced to great
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:179860:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtraights, rather than court ſome perſons for themſelves, yet can cheerfully do it for their friend, I could deny my ſelf eſtate, habitation, relations, any thing for my friend, but reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſcience; to ſacrifice the firſt were to lie under a crime unpardonable aniong men: the violating of the laſt a ſin inexcuſable before God: both which would make me too baſe for this concern; no perſon fit to be truſted with frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that can prodigally part with thoſe things ſo precious, that nothing can repair, or expiate.</p>
            <p>The fourth qualification: there muſt be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and openneſs of heart; freedom and frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is inſeparable; and can no more be divided then the cauſe from the effect; Reſervedneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be admitted: It is too late to lock the cabinet when the Jewel is gone: where I can give my heart, I can reſerve nothing: true love allows neither reſervation nor exception, all is free; their intercourſe is without violence. How inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating is affection! how eaſily it winds it ſelf into the heart? If I cannot live in the heart of my friend, he is no friend to me. And if he be an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen-hearted man he is open-handed: he that hath acceſſe to my heart, hath a key to my cabinet, or elſe no freedom, and conſequently no real frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. A generous man can as freely give as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, he hates covetouſneſs: If there can be no frendſhip without exchange of hearts, ſurely then the heart comprehends all things elſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and ſpeaks a full poſſeſſion of all things that are near and dear to a man. There is a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation of affairs between friends: all things
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:179860:51"/> are common: there is but one common ſtock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them it is true, the property may be in one, but the uſe muſt be in both: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo low as money among friends in their eſteem and value: and if they can part with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing elſe, they will never grudge that; nor can any prudence reſtrain a man who hath vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily put his friend into poſſeſſion, and bound himſelf to maintain it, and can no way be diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged but by the worſt perfidiouſneſs poſſible; there is no contending for propriety in this ſtate: if my eſtate ſnall not ſerve my friend, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give him that name.</p>
            <p>The fifth qualification is Wiſdom: a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man of underſtanding is of an excellent ſpirit; wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom makes the face of man to ſhine upon his friend with heart-gladning rayes. <hi>Solomon</hi> is ſaid in reſpect of his wiſdom that <hi>he was as an angel of God.</hi> And indeed nothing makes a man in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eſtate more divine than wiſdome. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be happy except his friend hath competent wiſdom. I grant that there are differences in men: ſome are not ſo capable as others: propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the wiſdom of our friend, ſo is our wealth in him; that is the greateſt treaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt excellent and uſeful: there are many intricacies a man winds himſelf into; ſometimes by impudence, othertimes by ignorance; the clue is in the heart &amp; hand of a judicious friend, that may bring him out: If my friend be wiſe, I can confide in him in the worſt of times: many plain-hearted men have been undone for want of this: how oft do we hear them complaining? all
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:179860:52"/> this evil is come upon me, becauſe I had no ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, wiſe, and faithſul friend to adviſe me in this or the other affair, but now it is too late, I am ruined: If <hi>Ioabs</hi> wiſdom had not interpoſed, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had been undone in that caſe concerning <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon.</hi> A wiſe man can ſee an evil before it comes, and extenuate it when it is come. <hi>A prudent man foreſees the evil, and hideth himſelf</hi> and his friend both; they will be together. It was no ſmall advantage to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> foreſaw the evil of famine coming upon the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when it came how eaſy it was made by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> the ſtory will inform us. There are many things to be done before we come to an undoing neceſſity: a wiſe man foreſees that, and does that now by way of prevention that an imprudent man would wiſh he had done, when the extremity is upon him. Wiſdom is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable in this regard, becauſe there is no great want, where it is rightly improved: it is the ladder by which men climb up to honour, and is uſeful in all conditions; in proſperity a wiſe man will remember that he is in ſlippery places, and therefore will look well to his ſteps; in adverſity, that he hath many temptations, and therefore muſt be ſerious and conſiderate. Let a wiſe man be caſt into never ſo much mire, and trampled upon, he ſparkles like a diamond ſtill; nothing can deprive him of his worth and excellency. True it is, that wiſe men are not always rich, nor rich men are not always wiſe, yet the former may and ſhall have the preheminency, riches and greatneſs being both ſubordinate to wiſdom:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:179860:52"/> the poor wiſe man delivered the city, when the king could not do it by his honour, wealth, and ſtrength: Have we matters of high truſt? none more fit to commit them to, then a wiſe man: In troubles he will ſupport, in ſtraights he will direct, in moſt perplexing buſineſs and puzling doubts he will adviſe when to be active, when to ſit ſtill; none fit for ſriendſhip but theſe: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there are that are faithful and affectionate, and would be very active, if they knew how, or in what method, but for want of wiſdom; They conclude all their good deſires in a few empty wiſhes, which may ſatisfy themſelves, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſerve their friends: but wife men are moſt uſeful, therefore much to be ambitioned: this is an indifpenſable quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y for friendſhip which muſt be endeavoured with all poſſible care.</p>
            <p>The Sixth qualification is faithfulneſſe: this is the cabinet that contains our moſt precious jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, I mean the ſecrets of the heart): ſecrecy in a friend is the moſt precious part of friendſhip, and that becauſe there is aſſigned to that part the higheſt truſt imaginable; a defect here cannot be without the greateſt treachery conceivable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes a perfect divorce, and ſtrikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very nature and eſſence of friendſhip; <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved that a faithful man conceales the matter. There are many things between friends; that are in no caſe fit to be revealed, nor cannot be done but with the greateſt treachery, becauſe thereby a man betrays the higheſt truſt, which nothing can make a crime more unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. The intercourſes between friends, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:179860:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> be revealed without detriment, becauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of kindneſs (though innocent) may by an unfaithful repetition, prove prejudicial and ſlaunderous. There are theſe things eſpecially in a faithful man, that challenges our reſpect and value, and renders him exceeding precious, Firſt, he is true, you may truſt him: he doth not wear like <hi>Jezabel,</hi> a painted outſide; or like the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants of our times, that hath the moſt endeared expreſſions in their mouthes, their voice is the voice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but their hands the hands of <hi>Eſau.</hi> And this is very much to be admired, eſpecially in perſons of ingenuity, becauſe men naturally love truth, and value things according to truth, Inſtance, a picture if it be never ſo curiouſly drawn, ſhall obtain no reputation, if it do not reſemble the perſon it repreſents. No wonder there is no more love in the world, men cannot truſt one another, <hi>Joab</hi>-like they cry, my brother, and ſmite deadly. Is not a faithful friend to be valued in ſuch times as theſe; when there is a lye in the right hand of thoſe that in complement pretend the greateſt reallity, if I cannot believe a man, I cannot truſt him, nor treat him without ſuſpicion, nor value him; nothing more deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to friendſhip, than falſhood; nothing more obliging than faithfulneſs.</p>
            <p>As a faithful man is true, ſo he is honeſt and juſt: he is a covenant-keeping man, as well as a covenant-making man; and this is conſiderable, becauſe in all friendſhips there muſt be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: you ſee that between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> the pattern of friendſhip: the covenant of God
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:179860:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> was between them: it is called the covenant of God by way of eminency: for every thing in Scripture that hath the name of God annexed to it, as the city of God, or the mountain of God, or the temple of God, this ſpeaks the eminency of thoſe things. The covenant between friends is not a trivial thing, but weighty, and ſeriouſly to be heeded : we ought not to break promiſe with an enemy, God hath ſeverely fallen upon covenant breakers, and good men have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſciencious in making good their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, as we may ſee in the caſe of the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Joſh. 9. 15. Joſhua</hi> knew that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, and that they had ſiniſterly brought him into league with them, yet the league being made <hi>Joſhua</hi> could be no way diſcharged by any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of prudence, piety or policy. Many men make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Seventh qualification is humility: This is like oyl that makes the wheels of friendſhip go more ſmoothly: how amiable is humility? It not only ſweetens the converſation of friends, but graces &amp; adorns them more than honour; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore honour is humility, ſaith the wiſe man; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is acceptable both to God and man; God aſcribes wiſdom unto it, with the lowly is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and man gives him greateſt reverence and reſpect; an humble man is a ſelf-denying man; he can heighten his friend and undervalue himſelf, he contentedly will decreaſe, that his friend may increaſe: how willingly will he throw of that applauſe from himſelf, he would court for his friend. Humility is a garment that becomes the greateſt prince in the world: An humble
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:179860:54"/> man ſtudies not ſo much his perfection, as his imperfections: he contentedly paſſes under a cloud without any noiſe, and thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt happy when leaſt obſerved: can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat when there is no reaſon for it, but his humility: h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> readily and freely ſubmits rather than make a quarrel whoever doth the injury: he is always on the yielding ſide; I do not mean a baſe ſubmiſſion by this compliance, as a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring that crime, which is properly anothers to my ſelf: this is the picking of a thorn out of another mans foot, and putting it into my own. Religion bids me ſubmit where there is cauſe, and reaſon tells me it is baſeneſs and puſillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do it where there is none. I ever abhorred an unworthy detraction and ſubmiſſion, as being againſt my reaſon and conſcience: it appearing unto me as high a piece of hypocriſie to condemn my ſelf, where I am ſure I am innocent, as it would be pride to juſtify my ſelf where I know I am guilty; beſides, hereby I put my ſelf into a neceſſity to beg that pardon from another, which otherwiſe he would have ſeen reaſon enough to have deſired of me: ſuch complements as theſe I could never fancy, nor rationally approve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I never ſaw any other effect proceeding from that cauſe, but ſhame and ſcorn, for men though never ſo criminal would gladly be thought innocent, yet they will not not be at charge to deſerve it: nor will men willingly conſult reaſon againſt themſelves; they will go thus far, and judge by the rule of contraries, if you are guilty, I muſt be innocent, How irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:179860:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> is it, for a man to brand himſelf to pleaſe another, thereby making himſelf liable to thoſe reflections that may one time or another prove more prejudiciall to his peace and credit, than any preſent advantage he could propound unto himſelf, in ſo baſe a piece of ſelf-denyall: I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought ſubmiſſion the beſt way of reconciling quarrels among equals, but rather the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual way to augment and heighten them. I would yield very far before I would make a quarrel with them I love, but if there could be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a juſt quarrel, I would not ſubmit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if I ſubmit, thereby I make my accuſer my judge in his own caſe, and muſt ſtand to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and though he might reprieve and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me at preſent, yet ſtill I lie under the laſh of his judgment, whenever he pleaſes to impoſe it; the fear of which would make me a perpetual ſlave, and ſtill confirm his juriſdiction over me, which I can never wreſt out of his hand, (having voluntarily inveſted him with it) without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding a greater quarrel then before; and that becauſe by this act I put an undervalue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and think him not worthy of that place I had firſt inveſted him with by my own voluntary act; which he will now hardly part with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe complyance and ſubmiſſion is ſo grateful to moſt perſons, that they having once obtained it, they will contend hard for it, rather than make a ſurrender. The moſt adviſable thing in this caſe, is, to forget the quarrel, and time will wear off that animoſity, and convince that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of friends is to make peace, rather then
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:179860:55"/> improve quarrels, and to be always ſtudying that method that may effect this to a mutual content and the leaſt prejudice. But I return from this digreſſion. In ſhort, humility hath theſe things to commend it: an humble man will eaſily admit of all manner of adreſſes; he is not lordly and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor doth he ſtand at ſo great a diſtance, as a proud man doth: this is very inſinuating &amp; capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the heart, by this means <hi>Abſolon</hi> ſtole the hearts of the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> again; an humble man cheerfully receives all complaints, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſtudies all manner of ſatisfaction to the complainants, and willingly complyes to all juſt and handſom things.</p>
            <p>The eighth qualification is reſolution; Neither time, place, nor perſon can make a true friend unfixed: time that wears every thing elſe, will rather beautify, ſtrengthen, and augment, then impair friendſhip, becauſe every day heapes up new endearments, by which it is made more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and confirmed. There is a tye upon friends that is like the marriage-knot, nothing but death can diſſolve; and indeed they have need to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, elſe they will never ſtand and fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which they muſt do, if they are real: cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in a friend is moſt neceſſary, eſpecially in time of imminent danger: a friend will not cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly looſe the life or reputation of his friend: he will hazard two in this caſe, rather than looſe one. <hi>Jonathan</hi> was a reſolved man, neither ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, life, or any thing could make him unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>David:</hi> every man is at his liberty before the friendſhip is made, but not afterward; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:179860:56"/> muſt be reſolved, There is no wiſdom in firſt reſolving and then making inquiries: we muſt conſider the charge of friendſhip before we begin and be ſatisfied in this, which is a great truth, that though friendſhip be moſt deſireable, yet it is not without trouble; no eſtate nor perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception in this lower land; you will finde diſappointments entailed upon the beſt of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things, which ſhould quicken our diligence and care, and heighten our reſolutions; friends muſt not be like bowls, that every ſmall rub will put off their byaſs: they muſt expect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny apples of ſtrife to be thrown between them by the devil and men of dividing principles: both envying the beauty and comelineſſe of that ſtate; friendſhip always attracts the eye: we ſee many gazing upon it, but not the heart, becauſe few underſtand it. They that have a near inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into the excellency of this ſtate have a high value for it, not ſo much for its outward beauty, as inward excellency: and theſe greatly eſteem a true and faithful friend though they have not alwaies opportunity to obtain it, others are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly uncapable of ever obtaining it, &amp; they hate the perſons in whom they ſee a capacity for it, meerly for their friendſhip; like the fallen angels that kept not their firſt eſtate, and therefore hates all thoſe, that are not plunged with them in the ſame unhappy eſtate. I have ſeen perſons great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpected while they carryed it at a diſtance each to other, but afterwards when they have been obſerved to unite in their affections, have been hated, vilified, ſcorned, and ſcandalized;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:179860:56"/> ſuch is the enmity there is in ſome perſons to this relation: and this may procecd from one of theſe cauſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Satan ſeems to be concerned in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: knowing that the improvement of reaſon and vertue mightily prepares the heart for grace, the young man in the Goſpel in reſpect of his morality was a great proficient, he is ſaid by the beſt teſtimony to be not farr from the kingdome of God. Men in friendſhip much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, becauſe they are alwayes ſtudying things grateful, comely, and acceptable, and in this united capacity, are not lyable to thoſe various temptations that men of contrary tempers are inſnared by, Satan perceiving this, ſtudies all poſſible means to imbitter this ſtate, and as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to reach that end, he ſets profane men at enmity againſt thoſe innocent perſons; and theſe are not only enemies to the pleaſure and profit of friendſhip, but are at enmity with the perſons, &amp; this proceeds from their ignorance as well as ſatans malice; they underſtand nothing of what they cenſure and revile, fondly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that every attainment they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e no part nor intereſt in, not worth the having; never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their own incapacity for it, who are ſo turbulent in their humors, croſſe in their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they can never arrive at ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſednes, as will comport with this temper: nor is it altogether ignorance, but envy alſo will be concerned, which delights in nothing more than to ſpot this innocent garment. I would never eſteem that friend that were not reſolved never
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:179860:57"/> to decline me upon any account whatſoever. This was a great amplification of <hi>Jonathans</hi> love unto <hi>David,</hi> his reſolution never to deſert him, rather running the hazard of his fathers diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the loſſe of his crown and kingdome, and which is more his precious life, then deal falſly in this covenant. I would take my friend, as a man takes his wife, for better for worſe, and reſolve with <hi>Ruth,</hi> whither thou goeſt I will go; where thou lodgeſt I will lodge, thy people ſhall be my people, thy God ſhall be my God, where thou dyeſt, I will dye, and there will I be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: reſolution is the note and character of a true friendſhip, and lowdly ſpeaks it neither tottering nor unſound. If <hi>Jonathan</hi> could have been corrupted in his love to <hi>David</hi> by any temptations, there was enough to do it; if threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, accuſations, or intreaties could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, it would have been done, as the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will inform us: but <hi>Jonathan</hi> could not fear the one, nor credit the other againſt his friend; nor is it every little ſlip in friendſhip it ſelf would do it: it muſt be ſome capital crime that can ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

               </gap> ſeparation; True it is that a man is not alwayes grateful to himſelf, and therefore cannot be ſo to any other, at all times, ſometimes friendſhip comes gloriouſly arrayed, othertimes is clothed in rags; ſhall a man decline his friend, becauſe he doth not appear always ſo ſplendid as at other times, and ſay he is no friend? this is as irrational, as to ſay a man is no man, becauſe he hath not on his beſt clothes: there are many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that may render a man leſſe pleaſing and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:179860:57"/> acceptable at one time than another: the various tempers of body and minde doth make a great change: theſe muſt be conſidered and allowed: little things will not ſtick with a reſolved friend.</p>
            <p>The ninth qualification is compaſſion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart: this is the cordial of frendſhip, and the hand that binds up the breaches in the heart, that which repairs the defects of nature and puts life into a dying perſon, this is that oyl that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runs into the wounds of a perplexed heart and heals it, that hand that wipes tears from the eye, and takes the burthen from the heart: it was not the ſmalleſt part of <hi>Jobs</hi> miſery, that he had not compaſſionate friends in his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: <hi>In affliction</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pitty ſhould be ſhewed by a friend,</hi> but miſerable comforters are you all. If there can be pleaſure in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction this is it, that I have a concerned friend: every compaſſionate friend is a man of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; he is afflicted in all that his friend is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and will as freely ſhare with him in his ſorrows, as in his comforts; this is matter of great lamentation in affliction that we have none to pitty us, the conſideration of that doubles the miſery and adds weight to the burden, but this cannot be the caſe of him that has a true friend: upon a ſick bed who makes the bed ſo eaſie, as a compaſſionate friend? no ſociety ſo pleaſant and diverting as he: in pain who is ſo merciful? in penury who is ſo bountiful? many will paſſe by in ſtraights, as the prieſt and the Levite did by the poor traveller; but a friend will, like the good Samaritan, give oyl for his wounds, and

Here the golden rule ſhines brightly, do you as you would be done unto. This was the ſeaſon <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> made uſe of to expreſs his bounty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion unto <hi>David.</hi> There is nothing more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging in frendſhip than compaſſion: a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling and ſympathy in our friend is very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when like the two twins Hiſtory ſpeaks of, theſe ſociable companions laugh and weep toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; theſe are like the ſtrings of a viol, touch one and the other trembles. As their ſufferings are mutual ſo are their ſatisfactions. A man is not ſeldom more concerned for his friend then for himſelf. I have experienced this, who have ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times born afflictions with ſo much the more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſatisfaction, becauſe it paſſed by my friend, and kindly took me: the reaſon is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe a great croſſe upon the body is more eaſily born, than that which is ſmaller upon the minde. It is with the minde as with the body, thoſe diſtempers that touch the vitals are more dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than them that are accompanied with more exquiſite pains in the body; ſo heart afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are moſt vexations: when my friend is under any affliction, my minde is troubled, and I feel that pain in my heart for him, that perhaps he feels far enough from his. I have been more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed and affrighted at the ſufferings of my friends, than I could have been at the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my own death, and would willingly have purchaſed life to them, by looſing my own.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:179860:59"/>
            <p>As compaſſion is free, ſo it is pleaſant: how cheerfully will a compaſſionate man look upon his friend in diſtreſſe? not that he is not ſorry for his affliction, but to ſhew how pleaſed he is to help and aſſiſt him: <hi>God loves a cheerful giver,</hi> ſo doth man. The aſpect of a man in giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving doth very often diſcover the heart of the giver; for men can hardly, handſomly diſſemble it here: when favours come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from perſons only moved by credit and relation, and not from love, how ſlowly do they come, the chariot-wheels do move heavily then, but when they come from a compaſſionate friend, they fly and come inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, nor is this all; compaſſion goes farther, to acts of clemency alſo: that is a true friend, who can heartily forgive, and paſſe by infirmities, without reflection: he will not make a quarrel upon every ſlight occaſion, he is more proue to pitty then to reprove, he doth not ſtudy excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but complyance: he will ever make the beſt interpretation poſſible: and look over the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of his friend with allowance, and where he finds a blot he will draw it fair again: he will treat him with all civility and tenderneſs, reprove kindly and ſeaſonably, excluding all manner of harſhneſs, cloathing himſelf with all humility, gravity, and civility: and upon the diſcovery of any error, if it be not very criminal, he will ſay as <hi>Eli</hi> did of his ſons, <hi>this is not a good report I hear of you, friend.</hi> Wiſdom as well as tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is alſo neceſſary in this caſe: the well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of a reproof is a very nice point, few underſtands it, and as few are acceptable and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:179860:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſucceſſeful in this regard. Amiableneſs in the countenance, ſweetneſs in the expreſſion are the beſt expedients, and ſeems to be the moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means, to convince without leaving the leaſt ſcar on the reputation, or diſquietneſs in the minde: few perſons love a reprover, yet <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> obſerved, that men of wiſdom do, <hi>reprove a wiſe man and he will love thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tenth qualification, there muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and delight as well as profit in a friend, a man takes more pleaſure in his friend, than in all the world beſide: all other things are to him at a diſtance, and we know things remote give no great delight; the more united, the more pleaſure: the ſun under a cloud is not ſo deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe it ſtands at a greater diſtance to the viſive faculty, as when it ſhines clearly without any interpoſition. <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved, that <hi>it was a pleaſant thing for the eye to behold the ſun,</hi> in its rayes, when nothing intervened between the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and the object: here are two things eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be conſidered in frendſhip in order to a compleat delight and complacency; that is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and propriety: Theſe ſeems to be the <hi>baſis</hi> upon which that fabrick ſtands: proportion not only prepares for it, but greatly ſupports it; and propriety conveys the pleaſure and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of frendſhip to the reſpective perſons, by multiplying endearments, and ſuch expreſſions which immediately proceed from a well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affection: how pleaſant is a Romance tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:179860:61"/> eaſily conſent becauſe of the nature of it which is ſublime and excellent, and yet eaſy and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: there we finde ſuch depths that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant may ſwim, ſuch ſholes that the lamb may wade; no greater pleaſure to the ſenſes (which muſt be ſatisfied as well as reaſon) then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of friendſhip, which is elivated by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of the perſon and the certainty of the intereſt that he hath in that perſon: <hi>David</hi> ſaith of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> that <hi>his love paſſed the love of women:</hi> proprietie and intereſt raiſes the affections and compleats the felicity of this concern: the words of a frend drops like an hony-comb, much more is a ſolid reaſon accepted, which is like muſick to the ear, light to the eye, and a cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the heart; ſtrips the perſon from his fears, and clothes him with ſerenity and peace; I can never fully ſpeak the excellency of this concern: give me leave to call in the teſtimony of thoſe that have fully enjoyed it at one time, but unhappily loſt it at another: theſe can more pathetically ſpeak the excellency of that ſtate; we never come ſeriouſly to prize things till after we have loſt them; and in our mourning habit we are moſt talkative about the pretiouſneſs of that we can never recall: that which aggravates any loſs, is the ſpeciality that is upon it: an only ſon or an only friend, this is that which imbitters the croſs; <hi>David</hi> ſadly reſented the death of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> it was a loſs as cruel as death, <hi>Davids</hi> complaint for <hi>Abſolon</hi> is the complaint of frinds when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence makes a finall ſeparation, <hi>would to God I had died for thee, my friend, my friend:</hi> may we
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:179860:61"/> not go higher, and with truth affirm, it's like the rending of the ſoul from the body, it is that one ſtroke which cuts the nerves and ſinews of all our comforts, pleaſure and delight: the compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of friendſhip is beyond the expreſſion of the beſt reaſon; therefore I cannot aim at a perfect diſcovery: <hi>I</hi> have given you my twilight appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of it; I proceed to the fourth thing which is the great end aimed at in the relation and ſtate friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the advantage and utility of friendſhip is firſt in our eye, as I could never fancy any man whoſe perſon was ungrateful, ſo I could not love one whoſe parts are not deſirable: I can love my friend for any worthy quality, and the more worthy the more he hath of my affections: perſons may without cenſure expect profit as well as pleaſure in thoſe things they dearly love, and this is neither mercinary nor unreaſonable, but moſt commenſurate and equivalent to the greateſt end of friendſhip; their ends in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern are the ſame that his was ſpoken of in the parable, that ſold all to purchaſe the field in which the pearl was. It was not the ſield but the treaſure he aimed at; ſo a man doth not love any perſon barely for himſelf, but as the cabinet that contains the Jewel he values, he doth not love the Jewel becauſe of the cabinet, but the cabinet with the reſpect to the Jewel: we ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally prize things, when we value them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their uſefulneſs: we prize water, the ſun, and bread, becauſe theſe are ſo neceſſary, that we cannot live without them; friendſhip in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:179860:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſome reſpect is as neceſſary; as our nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without ſtrengthning and nouriſhment, no more as we are ſociable can we be happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſociety: <hi>David</hi> was fully ſatisfied in <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> not more for the pleaſure he had in his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, as the benefit and profit of his counſel, advice, and directions, as alſo his example, which might prove as great an advantage to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> if not greater than any of the reſt: without queſtion that faithfulneſs and humility of <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> was as exemplary to <hi>David,</hi> as his aſſiſtance, and friendſhip was deſireable. A true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend is one of the richeſt talents God entruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us with: a rich man takes much delight to contemplate his money that lies in ſuch or ſuch a place, it is his only treaſure, <hi>and where the treaſure is there the heart will be,</hi> a mans friend is his treaſure, and as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved, <hi>money anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers all things,</hi> that is to ſay, that money can reach, with as great truth we may ſay that an ingenious man anſwers all things that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to a ſociable happineſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Society is one of the greateſt ends of frendſhip, that alliance was firſt contrived to promote ſociable happineſs; man is a ſociable creature, and there is nothing more equall and conſonant to his being and nature then ſociety, becauſe hereby he is moſt capable of doing and receiving good in that method and manner which is moſt ſuitable to his reaſon and nature, as alſo his inclination which is generous and not merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, he doth not wholly aim at himſelf; but that which amplifies the enjoyment is, that it is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:179860:62"/> and can reach the content both of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and the object: an ingenious man would not have a friend that cannot benefit him, becauſe then he could not be uſeful, nor will he ſo ſpend and confine his affection, if he ſees a worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon till he knows his reward, or receives earneſt by ſomething extraordinary: a true friend doth not ſtudy how to inrich himſelf by his friends bounty, but how to better himſelf by his virtues, or elſe by generous acts and obligations: he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore making ſuitable returns, nothing more contrary to vertuous perſons then to level at low ends; moſt ends are too low for love that noble affection, yet we cannot erre here, if our ſcope and aim be at religious principles and rational accompliſhments, the laſt makes us happy as men, the firſt as Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a mutual ſatisfaction is aimed at in this relation of Frendſhip, and that beyond what can poſſibly be obtained any where elſe: what relation is there that will ſo far comply as a true friend? there is none bound to ſtudy my humours but by my friend, who muſt do it, or he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deport himſelf for this relation: there are many paradoxes in frendſhip, but it is to them that are ſtrangers to the nature of this concern, the miſteries of frendſhip are very deep, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fathomed by perſons that are wholy ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and unacquainted with this concern: the ſociable delight and mutual ſatisfaction between friends, though it be very well underſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, is very intricate to thoſe at a diſtance, the conformity of friends are ſpeaking
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:179860:63"/> and acting alike, and ſubmitting the reaſon and will each to other: theſe are the hidden parts of frendſhip, and not viſible to every eye, the ſameneſs and ſimilitude that is between them is not apprehended by others, yet brings vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the perſons concerned, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſtrengthens and confirms the alliance: we love thoſe that are like our relations, much more thoſe that are like our ſelves; how pleaſantly can a father look upon his image in his ſon? and the more ſuitableneſs appears in their diſpoſitions, the more rooted and grounded is their affection; we plainly ſee, there can be no frendſhip between perſons of contrary tempers, but rather antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, that which we call prudence is not known among them; for if a man hates a perſon, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes all things that are about him; ſo if he loves a perſon he approves of all things that concern him: when the will of friends are melted, and like lead run into the ſame mold, then this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and the mutual ſatisfaction of both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is attained: contrary tempers are like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary creatures, ſtill at variance: Pride and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, patience and paſſion, folly and ingenuity, pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re reſolution and contentedneſs with every thing, eſpecially that which cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided but with a fundamental deſtruction: To be ſatisfied with the comfort of frendſhip without ſubmiſſion to the croſſes, is a foundation-errour,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:179860:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> and will occaſion a breach irreparable; in our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſtate, natural defects that cannot be cured: theſe therefore muſt not be reflected on in a way of diſcontent; to reprove or impoſe an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility is alike irrational; it's moſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſpute impoſſibilities, and unkinde to make grating reflections, becauſe they ſtill turn to ſcorn and ſcandal, if they be publick, and to diſcontent and trouble, though they be never ſo private: I can look upon the natural defects of my friends with more pleaſure then the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of another, becauſe they are parts of what I dearly love, and ſo much of himſelf that they cannot poſſibly be divided, otherwiſe I would ſooner take part of them my ſelf then diſlike them in him: In the firſt choice I had my freedom, &amp; might have declined the whole if I could not be reconciled to every part, but now I cannot make exceptions but at this hazard, the loſs of my friend, or at the leaſt a perſwaſion in him that I cannot love him ſo intirely as I ought, and the relation juſtly challenges: Beauty is not much in frendſhip, a ſociable and amicable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is much more neceſſary, if this be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it is not like ſome natural defects in the body that art can mend, nothing can ſupply; all the art of reaſon and religion together cannot do it; we ſee this in angry <hi>Jonas,</hi> whom God could not pleaſe, he thought he did well to be angry with God himſelf. I have ſometimes taken much pleaſure in contemplating the ſatisfaction I have obſerved among friends, how ſtudious they have been to pleaſe each other? how ready
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:179860:64"/> to ſerve? how impatient of any interruption to their ſocial delights? how unſatisfied if they could not in all reſpects reach a mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? If to have the greateſt contrivance, how to promote our intereſt in the world in reſpect of credit, eſtate, or life, be a ſatisfaction, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is that. If the greateſt love, the higheſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, the ſweeteſt embraces, the moſt conſtant and pleaſing communion, care, love, goodneſs, faithfulneſs, bounty, ready ſervice be deſirable, then friendſhip is moſt incomparable. How eaſy ſuffering, how pleaſant ſervice, and how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable do life appear, where mutual ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is in view; where a man would otherwiſe indulge himſelf and ſit down and conſider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a chargeable and painful undertaking before he will venture upon it; it is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble where mutual ſatisfaction is aimed at, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in great enterpriſes and high undertakings, let the concluſion be never ſo good, if death or any cruel accident have divided the friends, the contents is not half what it would have been, had it been mutual: the end aimed at was the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of both, which being ardently deſired, but really loſt, is conſtantly lamented, and inſtead of a gainful poſſeſſion there remains nothing but a melancholy diverſion; this conſtantly torments the minde, which if unquiet will imbitter the ſweeteſt enjoyments, <hi>David</hi> could not receive the news of victory with any ſatisfaction, becauſe <hi>Abſolon</hi> was ſlain, who probably he intended rather to reduce then deſtroy: promiſing himſelf a mutual benefit by that victory, how eager are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:179860:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> friends to promote the pleaſure one of another? they remove all impediments and ſtudy all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients to that effect. He is no friend that hath not experienced this, that upon any offence g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ven as occaſioned by him he finds as much trouble in his own heart, as can poſſibly poſſeſs the heart of his friend: grief and anger preſently employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the firſt that any occaſion ſhould be given, or taken to diſcompoſe his friend; the laſt, that he ſhould do any thing to procure it together with thoughts and cares how this breach may be made up again; It is probable every method will not do it. I would bear with any thing rather than conſent to a quarrel with a perſon I dearly loved, but if offences were cauſeleſly taken, I would think it more prudence to diſpute it than ſubmit. If I ſubmit I am not only beholding for a pardon, but confeſs the crime, and become my own judge to condemn my ſelf. I have obſerved, let the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion be never ſo ingenious, if the fault be thought great, it will prove but the skinning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the wound, and upon a more muture conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſeem but a ſmall ſatisfaction. If credit and reputation are concerned in the quarrels and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably ſow the ſeed of ſuſpition in the heart; to prevent this, deliberation ſeems moſt adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in which time the preſent paſſion and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity may wear of, and reaſon may be heard on both ſides, and they may be inclined, rather to loſe ſomething of their own right, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear exact or punctual, the law of friendſhip ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely forbidding all ſuch exactneſs. I would make any interpretation ſerve, rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger

I mean by this, that which ſtrikes againſt the nature &amp; eſſence of friendſhip. Inſtance, as the revealing of a ſecret, a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous blow, revilings, by which my reputation may be impaired for ever: if ſuch as theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a breach, it is like that of a venice glaſſe that can never piece again; art may mend it, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can cement and repair it: there may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings pro and con, and the beſt argument may carry it for the preſent, but there cannot be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference occaſioned by any wilful diſobligation in any caſe allowed it being a crime unpardonable, and that which I would never ask forgiveneſs of; nor could I be ſatisfied in any friendſhip I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw any thing could intervene deſtructive to it. I could never love one, I thought, I could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be induced to hate: ſuch a thought would prove a grief, that would drown my comfort, and fill my heart with thoſe doubts that never could admit of ſatisfaction. I come now to the fifth thing premiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the ways and friendſhip is ſtrewed with. Here are many flagrant flowers, we ſhall gather them as we go.</p>
            <p>The firſt fragrant flower is this; a man hath ſomething ſecure in the moſt uncertain times, and that is no ſmall advantage: you know fortune is very uncertain; the wheel is up to day and down to morrow, and what more common, than to ſee men valued or undervalued according to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:179860:66"/> their preſent ſtate, in relation to outward things? all admire thoſe that are uppermoſt, trampling upon every thing beneath them, looking more at the outward varniſh, then the inward luſtre; pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſcpulchres make a gaudy ſhew, yet have no real pleaſure in them, becauſe though they are fair to the eye, they are filled with nothing but rottenneſs and corruption. Moſt perſons look at the ſuperficial part of a man, wholly judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſenſe without the leaſt appeal to reaſon, which ought to be firſt ſatisfied in every doubtful caſe, elſe we may be byaſſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the dark miſtake things to our prejudice. I have read a ſtory of a traveller, that came to a painter in a kinde of diſguiſe, and deſired to be imployed, being of the ſame profeſſion, and though a great artiſt very meanly accoutred, the painter received him, and treated him according to the meanneſs of his preſent capacity; bread and cheeſe was his fare, which this artiſt thought a diet too courſe for his fine art; he preſently paints his mean food moſt exquiſitely, and goes his way, leaving his new maſter to lament his ignorance and prejudice in looſing ſo gainful a fervant, which was aggravated by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that attended it; the maſter returning miſſed his ſervant, but found his breakfaſt (as he ſuppoſed,) and though he were an artiſt, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly confeſſed, that the repreſentation ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as real to his ſenſes, as the true food did to his reaſon. The hidden parts of friendſhip are not viſible to all the world, perſons in the relation doth not like money carry their value in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:179860:67"/> yet they are not without true worth, a man can prize his friend in rags as well as in robes. <hi>Jonathan</hi> would rather ſtrip himſelf for <hi>David</hi> than deſpiſe him, for want of robes he did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate his affection to <hi>David</hi> though he was thrown out of all his honour and ſplendour he had in <hi>Sauls</hi> court, and was hunted up and down as a pattridge upon the mountains; in proſperity a man will be preſent with his friend, and conſult him how to manage that eſtate with humility and general content; times of proſperity requires the help of a friend as much as adverſity. The rich hath many friends, few frue friends. It is much harder to manage a great eſtate, than that which is meaner. Men of great eſtates have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly greater hearts, and that is the reaſon they have no more content; in the midſt of their ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies, they are in ſtraights: they have many flatterers, few real friends, as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had: many that are at their table, that eat their bread, inſinuate into their ſecrets, and yet lift up their heel againſt them. <hi>Davids</hi> table was not without theſe, many a good natured man is ruined for want of a faithful friend; we finde that while <hi>Iehojada</hi> lived, <hi>Ioas</hi> did well, he was a faithful friend, but when he died, <hi>Ioas</hi> was ſoon ruined and undone.</p>
            <p>A faithful man is ſure in all times, and upon all occaſions. Many accidents may rob a man of his eſtate, nothing but death can take away his friend. A man can ſuffer the loſſe of all carthly comforts, and not think himſelf quite undone, ſo long as he hath his friend, which may prove
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:179860:67"/> ſtrength in weakneſs, pleaſure in perplexity, treaſure in poverty, a ſympathizer with him in all conditions, and will be with him in all places, nothing but death ſhall be able to make a final ſeparation; he will ſtick at nothing; ingenuity is noble and generous; neither priſon nor penury ſhall frighten him: theſe are the ſeaſons which he rather courts than fears, becauſe he can here beſt evidence his immutability.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſecond flower we ſhall gather in this way of friendſhip, is a ſupport in the moſt dreadful afflictions; in proſperity help is near, in adverſity it ſtands at a diſtance: the rich have many friends, but the poor is hated of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: how ſeaſonable is ſupport in time of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; at ſuch a time we value kindneſs at a high rate, that being the proper ſeaſon for it, becauſe we try our friends then whether they will aſſiſt, when others will not or cannot: there are no ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo proper and convenient for this purpoſe as times of great ſtraits &amp; extremites, when may be the condition of a man muſt not be known by his deareſt relations, nor can be but at a hazard of his life or credit: ſuch was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, when he fled from <hi>Saul;</hi> and ſuch is many a mans caſe: inſtance, in time of great loſſes and other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet a friend muſt acquaint himſelf with theſe puzling affairs, elſe he cannot diſcharge the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obligation he lies under: he is bound not to deſert his friend, and reſolves with <hi>Peter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his maſter; though all forſake, he will never forſake him. I would be more diligent to enquire after the neceſſities of my friend, than
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:179860:68" rendition="simple:additions"/> after any other thing that concern him, not that I love trouble and ſorrow, but I love my friend, and cannot decline that which is inſeparable from him; and if I cannot enjoy him no where elſe, but in the furnace of affliction, I ſhould not think that too hot, a priſon would be ſweeter to me were he preſent than a palace without him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I accept ſufferings more heartily with him then pleaſure without him, and this is no <hi>paradox,</hi> If the ſerenity of the minde be beyond the eaſe of the body, and reaſon more to be indulged then ſenſe: it's true prudence may facilitate troubles if the heart be calm, but nothing can do it if that be unquiet; the heart knows his own bitterneſs, no perſon elſe can, except a friend, becauſe hearts are united in friendſhip, and there is a ſympathy; I will ſtudy all methods to ſupport &amp; ſupply my friend, and when I could do it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I would voluntarily ſuffer with him rather than forſake him: love that warm affection maks adverſity eaſy, at leaſt not ſo intollerable.</p>
            <p>The third flower we gather in the way of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is a counſellor in doubts. Many ſcruples doth aſſail and perplex the heart of a man which in credit and conſcience he dares not reveal to ſtrangers. This hath proved the ruine of many a man, and hath betrayed them into many ſad temptations, as murther, rapine, and all manner of cruelty, not only againſt their neareſt relations, but againſt their deareſt lifes, occaſioned either through melancholy, inprudence, raſhneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe might have been prevented by a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frend, by whom they might have been awed,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:179860:68"/> conſelled, and prevailed with to avoid thoſe ways and methods that lead to ſuch extremities, and by whom their ſcruples might have received a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſatisfactory reſolution, whoſe tenderneſs would have invited him to uſe all perſwaſive and pacifying arguments. I have ſeen direful effects my ſelf ariſing from ſuch cauſes, how happy had ſome been of my near acquaintance, had they had a faithful friend to have divided their cares, and untye thoſe knots, melancholy was dayly tying to their deſtruction: how eaſily might thoſe webs that ſeemed intricate to them ſpun by the policy of Satan, and cruel melan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>choly (that irrational and black companion) have been unravelled, before they could have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thoſe dreadful ends that have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of them, you know that a man ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unravels that which hath been the work of time: a few well ſtated arguments hath and may through the bleſſing of God beat down the batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that the devil makes againſt the precious life of man, as mental diſcontents are moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: ſo ſecrecy in this regard is moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe the greateſt policy the devil hath, is to keep this fire within a mans heart: there he kindles a ſpark which ſoon blazes to deſtruction, eſpecially when melancholy blowes the ſpark; the more ſecret fire is, the more dangerous; a ſpark may eaſily be put out before it comes to a flame, but after it may be impoſſible: no bodily affliction like heart-trouble, yet theſe are not to be ſlighted. <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and many men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſtracting pains, as the gout and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:179860:69"/> other violent diſtempers, hath found friends very neceſſary, when by a gentle hand their wounds dreſſed, their bodies ſupported, when by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring and content they receive that pleaſure, that is not only uſeful, but exceedingly neceſſary in ſuch extremities.</p>
            <p>The fourth fragrant flower we find in frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a companion in ſolitary and ſad times, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety being never more pleaſing then in ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I do not mean by ſolitarineſs, that retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appointed for ſpecial duty, and ſerious contemplation; but ſuch as is the conſequence of ſome cruel confinement, whereby we are deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe innocent recreations and harmleſs diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which would repair nature, that is often tired in conflicting with thoſe diſtractions and cares that conſtantly attend ſuch a priſon-ſtate, were the heart always upon the wing and fit for divine contemplation, a cave that dark habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be as <hi>Goſhen,</hi> a land of light: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is hard to improve ſolitarineſs to any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: as I would with much content enjoy my thoughts, and diſcourſe with my ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſo I would as gladly at other times ſpeak my joyes, and ſad apprehenſions of things to my friend, by which I ſhall double the firſt, and may diminiſh the laſt; beſides I ſhall have this advantage, if I ſpeak my thoughts I ſhall ſee what they are by their dreſſe, whether trivial or weighty. I cannot always improve my reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or be ſo taken with my own conceptions and apprehenſion of things as to believe them without exception or paſſible, unleſs confirmed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:179860:69"/> by thoſe who are more judicious, or at leaſt more indifferent, then I can be in matters that ſo nearly concern me, arguments debated between two or more ſeems to be more clear, becauſe they have a greater teſtimony, than when there is not that advantage: a ſingle teſtimony will not be accepted in civil things: men can hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade ſingly in a matter of importance: we ſee our lawyers and doctors though never ſo learned are hardly creditted except they refer to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: nor are we without a divine teſtimony in this caſe, as the Scriptures, which declare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every thing ſhall be eſtabliſhed; the great conceit that ſome men have had of their private notions, which may be, have ſo tickled and pleaſed them that they have ſate down highly ſatisfied with the validity of them, hath been that which hath proved their greateſt prejudice, and often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a deluſion, that pride hath flattered them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to making that appear great to themſelves that looks throw a multiplying-glaſs which doubles the ſpecies, when indeed if it be rightly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by an impartial reaſon and looked upon by a ſingle eye will appear little, and if rightly argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſcourſed by a ſecond perſon, who can impartially weigh both ſubſtance and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, will merit rather ſhame and conviction, than reputation and ſatisfaction. I cannot refreſh my ſelf with any lawful recreation without a companion, which will ſweeten my melancholy walks and ſhorten the long nights; my meat will not reliſh well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor my ſleep refreſh and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:179860:70"/> me without a ſociable companion: my walks will beweariſome, my work will be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, my time will be long, my opportunity of doing and receiving good very ſhort: I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manage my general nor particular calling with profit and advantage: I fancy I ſhall live without being deſired, and dye without being la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
            <p>The fifth flower is a ſupply in the moſt unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table times: this muſt come in as a principal part of frendſhip, which is ever generous and free: a man will deny himſelf ſooner than his friend, and think it the beſt policy, becauſe his content is more than his money, which he can never enjoy, while he ſees his friend in want, how ſpeedily will help come? our Saviour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this, (ſaith he) if a man come at midnight to his friend, he will ariſe in all haſt to give him what he needs. Men are not at liberty to give, or not to give: So ſoon as the frendſhip is made, we preſently come under an obligation, and may as well deny all other acts of friendſhip, as that, I would be aſhamed to own that friend, that ſhould not ſhare in my eſtate, or enjoy any thing in plenty while he is in penury, he that can keep his money, can keep his heart, and therefore not fit to be confided in. I have ſometimes thought the love of money hath been the cauſe why there is ſo little frendſhip amongſt men: many have bid fair for frendſhip but could never obtain it, becauſe the cares of the world, and the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of riches have ſo incumbred the heart, that no place could be found for ſuch an intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:179860:70"/> If your friend be right, there is no doubt of any thing within his power, he will rob him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rather than decline you, and will without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute make his eſtate if you need it more yours than his own.</p>
            <p>The ſixth flower in this way is, the protection and ſafety we have in a true friend: he will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with us and for us; you need not want a protector if the ſtrength of your friend can do it: he will accompany you in danger, and bring you out of it, if poſſible, though he loſe his life in the ſervice; he will preſerve your credit and think no act ſo honourable as to loſe his life for a generous friend. Many inſtances we have of this in hiſtory: a coward is too baſe for frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: I would not lead my friend unto danger, nor would I impoſe any truſt in him that ſhould leave me there: If any thing can ſeparate friends, they bare only the name, never knew the nature of frendſhip: it is a miſtery ſtill, ſuch knowledg is too excellent for them, they cannot attain it: It is heroick and noble to prefer the life of my friend before my own, though I am as good as he; and hereby I ſhew my humility as well as frendſhip, and ſo add excellency to the action, becauſe humility and charity puts a value upon things, that otherwiſe would be equal: we are bound to dye in ſome ſenſe for all Chriſtians, and therefore more obliged to do ſo for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an friend, who is to us in this ſtate of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the moſt perfect injoyment, and that which ſuppoſeth and includeth all things els that may render us happy.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:179860:71"/>
            <p>The ſeventh and laſt flower this way of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is ſtrowed with, (to name no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haſten) is this: we have a friend, that will be with us in life, and for us when we are dead. This is a flower of the greateſt fragrancy, you need not diſcompoſe your minde about your children, what ſhall become of them when you are gone, in reſpect of care and proviſion, ſince you have left half your ſelf behind: with how much ſatisfaction doth a man or woman die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond others, that hath a faithful friend, their cares are not about their children, they have left them in a ſafe hand, they neither fear cheats nor wrongs or any unkindneſs that can be avoided by the inſpection, care, and prudence of a faithful friend. <hi>David</hi> had a reſpect to the ſon of <hi>Jonathan</hi> &amp; ſet him at his own table. Duration is that which heightens the value of any thing, things of ſhort continuance are not much deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; though they are ſometimes pleaſant, they are not ſo profitable: would you leave a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jewel to poſteriry when you are gone, make ſure of a true friend? would you live when you are dead? would you have a name that ſhould never be blotted out? would you have your ends accompliſhed concerning your near and dear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? a true friend is moſt likely to effect theſe ends, who will extend your vertues, bury all your imperfections, and ingrave that praiſe and honour upon your tomb, that ſhall not be raſed for ever. poſterity are conſiderable, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lye near the hearts of parents; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe, nor any thing elſe to an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:179860:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> man is ſo precious next to his ſoul, as repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation whereby he bloſſomes in the duſt, and is had in everlaſting remembrance. we come now to the ſixth thing promiſed; namely, how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our ſelves in the ſtate of frendſhip in order to the preſerving of it: and we muſt wiſely ponder ſuch things as theſe, and ſincerely practice them, as thoſe that are moſt grateful.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſet a value upon your friend above any earthly thing: you muſt love him as you love your ſelf: think him worthy of the beſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and he muſt have it without reſervation, or exception: think no ſervice too hard, no ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings too much: make him equal to your ſelf in your care and thought: let nothing in the world ſtand in oppoſition to him, or in competition with him, there are 4. things that raiſes our value and eſteem; intrinſecal worth: uſefulneſs: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety: and a real affection: he muſt be worthy, elſe not capable of frendſhip, (as hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed:) we have ſeen the qualifications, which ſpeaks him eminently uſeful: this worth being attended with benefit, our propriety in all which makes him incomparably alſo deſireable, and if real affection be added, that will challenge our higheſt eſteem and value.</p>
            <p>Secondly, be not harſh in your reproofs: no friend is ſo perfect but may need it: but do it tenderly in the ſpirit of meekneſs. Saith <hi>David,</hi> if the righteous reprove me, it ſhall be baulm that ſhall not break my head: he doth not ſay, it ſhall not break my heart, by a ſunlike thaw, but it ſhall not break my brain (was his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:179860:72"/> by diſtracting and perplexing thoughts, and It is more proper for reproof to break the heart then the head: that heing the genuine end aimed at among friends: but here we muſt be wiſe: diſcretion is very neceſſary in a matter ſo difficult as the well regulating of reproof, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral methods of reproof, and you muſt ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudy which of them will ſuit the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in this lies the excellency of a wiſe reprover: ſometimes words and arguments will do beſt, and are moſt expedient: and theſe ſeem moſt proper for men of patience and reaſon, who will attend and weigh things, in the ballance of a rectified judgement. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of theſe when he ſaith, Reprove a wiſe man and he will love thee. A wiſe man loves the reproof when it is well managed and ſeaſonably applyed. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a look is ſufficient to reprove, our Saviour did but look upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and this work was done. Sometimes the contrary example will do much. Laſtly to reprove in the perſon of another, ſeems the moſt ſucceſſeful way of reproving, becauſe by this without any noiſe; or ungrateful reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you will ſeriouſly and ſeverely enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. Thus <hi>David</hi> was reproved by <hi>Nathan</hi> the prophet: by this means a man is brought ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to condemn himſelf, and ſave you the labour; never caſt any diſgrace upon reputation, that is a tender thing, a man would take it as kindly you ſhould touch his life as his credit: then be ſure what you tax him with be true: never go upon fancy and ſuppoſitions, this will ſpeak you raſh, and it will grieve your friend extreamly to be
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:179860:72" rendition="simple:additions"/> cauſeleſly impeached by you who is bound by all manner of obligation to make the moſt favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſtruction: charity as well as frendſhip en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns you, never to make an evil interpretation, where you can poſſibly make a good one: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are tempted to make exceptions, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect your ſelf, may be you take offence where none is given: look into your heart, and ſee that you are free from pride &amp; paſſion, pride will raiſe a ſtorm in the ſereneſt temper, paſſion will caſt a miſt upon the cleareſt underſtanding; beſides you prejudice your ſelf if you are not deliberate and careful, how abaſhed is a man when he hath reproved raſhly? with how much ſhame is he forced to detract and ſubmit, and inſtead of a Judge, as he was in the ſeat of reproof, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſuppliant, where he is not always ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, may be the injury was ſo great that bare ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion would not do it; there muſt be ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the firſt is ſhameful, the laſt chargable; and this, becauſe the offence may be aggravated by circumſtances which will admit of no repair, theſe might eaſily have been prevented at the firſt by a ſolid and religious deliberation: in all things ſudden and unexpected we ſhould fuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend judgment till reaſon be fully ſatisfied: we every day experience this, that what we madly reſolve with <hi>Jonas,</hi> we ſoberly repent with <hi>Eſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, whatever you apprehend ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in your friend, never reprove at a diſtance, or by proxy, much prejudice may be conveyed this way, I mean by theſe meſſages or written quarrels. Theſe are very dangerous and ſhake
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:179860:73"/> the foundation of frendſhip: Inſtance,</p>
            <p>Firſt, hereby you impeach your friend, and article againſt him, and that you cannot do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſobliging words, which if by any accident made publick, they may admit of diverſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations; which interpretations will be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fancies of thoſe perſons into whoſe hands they may unfortunately come, and from hence may ariſe this prejudice; the hazard or loſs of a reputation; you will afterwards but in vain ſadly lament: many ſhoot here in juſt, but kill in earneſt: Reputation is not to be dallied with, becauſe if it be once loſt, it is like yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that will never come again.</p>
            <p>Again, you can hardly avoid the revealing of ſome ſecret, paſſion is a meer blab, &amp; ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that it will never make any reflections back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nor forward, as to think, what reaſon have I for it? or what prejudice may come by it? the diſcloſing of a ſecret is always diſobliging, and not to be excuſed, though it be accidentally, not intentionally done. That is a thing that may not be left to hazard: it is like the defiling of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-bed, and of all crimes in frendſhip the moſt unpardonable, becauſe beſides much other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, it blots and defaces your evidences and aſſurance of the affection of your friend; whom you have ſo juſtly incenſed, that much time may paſſe over before a right underſtanding will be fixed between you again, if ever: I ſaw a frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip broken by this, that it never peeced again. Nor is it without this inconvenience always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, that I do not only ſpeak unadviſedly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:179860:73"/> at the preſent, but leave it upon record, and that may be againſt me for ever, writings being for duration, as well as for ratification, and by this adventure we not ſeldom ſeal a prejudice and witneſs together againſt our ſelves, that may riſe up in judgment whenever the keeper plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and may poſſibly prove a Lion that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour all our hope and comfort, when we leaſt ſuſpect it.</p>
            <p>As I would not write quarrels, ſo I would not ſend them by the wiſeſt perſon I ever yet ſaw, I fancy I never met with any perſon prudent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make up differences between dear and intimate friends; my reaſons are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, friends cannot be more friends one to another then to themſelves, therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline judgment in their own caſe, and addreſſe themſelves to a third perſon, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but to be vindicated, which they both expect: nor can this third perſon be a competent judge, becauſe he can never be rightly informed if there be any ſecrecy in the caſe, becauſe all friends lie under this reſtriction, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal a ſecret that would widen the breach, and make it ſo much the more impoſſible ever to be mended, and would prove like the ſtopping of blood in the noſe, by wounding the heart.</p>
            <p>I argue thus, this third perſon muſt be ſuch a perſon, as muſt have the command of both, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he will be over-born, and then he muſt act as a mediator or a Judge; if as a mediator he muſt intreat both, can command neither, and then will very hardly reconcile them; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:179860:74"/> one from the other, what he requires from both, that is compliance and ſubmiſſion: If he act as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udge, he muſt acquit or condemn, he cannot acquit both; there muſt be a fault ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, otherwiſe there could be no quarrel, nor can be condemn both with any kind of prudence, for then he leaves them, as he found them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied ſtill, if not about their guilt (for poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they may be convinced they were both in a fault) yet about the meaſure they may diſpute; one will ſay he is not ſo much guilty as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: now unleſs this laſt which is the guilt can be determined and aſcertained, nothing is done, and this cannot be done but by a definitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon one of the two, which will be ſo far from making peace, that it will promote and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the quarel, becauſe before whateverjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſed between them upon either was but judging in their own caſe, and might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by either without any further breach, but now being condemned by a perſon mutually choſen, the judgment muſt ſtand again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t that perſon convicted, and ſo the quarrel muſt reſt groundedly on that ſide, which will hardly be ſubmitted to by the other, ſo then the reſult will be this, the quarrel that was only between two before, is now between three. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, he that meddles with contention, takes a bear by the foot; and may get a ſnap for his pains, but this is ſure he ſhall never paſs without a blot. It is moſt true, that as differences among friends ought with all prudence to be concealed, ſo if once they come to be publick, they can hardly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:179860:74"/> remain friends. I would with much more content in this caſe make a new friendſhip than repair the old, this being more chargeable and hazardous, that being more eaſy and certain.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Do not readily accuſe your friend, nor hearken to them that doth it: the leaſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in this caſe as it will incourage an enemy, ſo you your ſelf may be inſnared: with the well adviſed is wiſdom: if you argue wiſely you will never accuſe raſhly, ſee that there be good ground for an accuſation before you receive it, leaſt you fail of your evidence, and retreat with ſhame and loſſe: nor muſt you give an ear to others in this matter becauſe this may convey prejudice into your heart inſenſibly, and make ſo deep an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which though never ſo falſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded will never afterwards give place to the greateſt truth, having taken the firſt poſſeſſion, nor be clearly raſed by the beſt policy, it may diſappear ſometimes, but like an apparition at other times it will appear again, and poſſibly prove a conſtant vaxation either to the fancy as to a mans felf, or by reflexions from others. It ſeems more prudence to ſtop the ear againſt an accuſation, then ſtudy the moſt compendious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; becauſe a man is as likely to be corrupted as the accuſer is to be convinced, eſpecially if the laſt can more wittily manage the ſcandal, then the firſt can the truth, varniſhes will ſet off much, and men thtough careleſneſs ſometimes conſent to what they could not rationally believe, if they would take the pains to conſult reaſon; I think I would ſet my head and my heart at work rather
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:179860:75"/> than by any conſent of mine, give ſatisfaction to perſons at enmity with frendſhip, or with my friend, as to hearken, much leſſe give the leaſt credit to their impeachments: I ſhould be very unwilling ſo much to promote my own diſquiet; who can have little peace if ſuch an Achan lay in my boſom, which might ſecretly cut the knot of frendſhip, or raiſe ſuch a ſtorm, that could not eaſily be allayed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, do not in all companies commend your friend above an ordinary pitch: this may prove his greateſt prejudice: he that riſeth early in the morning to commend his friend, the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>it ſhall be counted to him as a curſe:</hi> We have a remarkable inſtance of this in <hi>Saul,</hi> the women anſwered ane another as they played, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Saul hath ſlain his thouſands, and</hi> David <hi>his ten thouſands, and</hi> Saul <hi>was very wroth, and this ſaying diſpleaſed him, &amp;</hi> Saul <hi>eyed or envied</hi> David <hi>from that day forward.</hi> Hereby you draw many envious perſons nearly to inſpect every of his actions, &amp; in caſe of the leaſt flaw appearing either in life or birth, improve them to his diſadvantage: rather contemplate and imitate his perfections then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe them, leſt you meet with ſubtle men who are reſolved in oppoſition to you (though may be no way prejudiced againſt him you pleade for at the preſent) who will be as induſtrious to fix a ſcandal as you are to attribute real worth, and they may haply finde more arguments for that aſpertion, though falſe, then you can for the truth, eſpecially if you undertake the defence of what you cannot unqueſtionably maintain, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:179860:75"/> ſo as your argument falls, the credit of your friend looſes, beſides you are apt to miſtruſt and heſitate about that you cannot ſay more for, then another can ſay againſt, and ſo inſtead of bringing your friend into reputation with others, he may looſe his credit worth you; not becauſe he deſerves it, but becauſe you were not rightly informed and prepared to undertake ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes: Let your friends good works commend him in the gates: all his praiſe-worthy qualities muſt be private, or publick, or both: if private, not always fit to be proclaimed, they being never ſo good, are liable to cenſure by them that like ſpiders ſuck poyſon where others finde honey: the excellency of frendſhip may be ſo interpreted that much prejudice may accidentally inſue thereby: ſome men are prone to cenſure, what they cannot underſtand, others willingly ſhut their eyes, becauſe they cannot look upon that without prejudice in another, which makes them ſo much more ſplendid than themſelves: It is with them, as with the weak eye which cannot behold the ſun in its body, not that there is any defect in the object but the defect is in the viſive faculty which ſhould receive the ſame.</p>
            <p>Again, if they be publick, they need no pleader, they will plead for themſelves, and force a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from thoſe that are not wholy barbarous, or (that which is worſe) prepoſſeſſed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded prejudice. I never ſaw high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, but they were ſeconded with excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the arguing of which have created many a quarrel, and ſet the end aimed at, at a greater diſtance.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:179860:76"/>
            <p>Sixthly, if you have been free and generous to your friend, never upbraid him with it: this is moſt baſe and diſingenious, and that which a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit would bluſh to think of: nothing is more diſobliging than this, and ſpeaks a man of a lower ſpirit: hereby he doth not only underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue his friend, but he diſcharges him of an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he greatly lay under before, and puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of any expectation of a compenſation, let his civilities be what they will; I could never think my ſelf obliged where upbraided, that being a rate too dear for any courteſy: and in this caſe I may more juſtly expect ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than give it: I would never beſtow my bounty except I ſaw reaſon for it; and having given I ſhould think nothing more unreaſonable then to repine. Never look after gratuities when you have ſent them away, nor call them again by repentance, for nothing will return but a great damage, a juſt prejudice, and a ſpot no time nor endeavour will be able to wipe out.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, never carry your ſelf ſo that your friend may fear you, this contrary paſſion will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſtate of that relation, love being changed unto fear will frighten and amaze where it ſhould induce and incline. This is moſt oppoſite to love and ſpeaks it imperfect, otherwiſe it would caſt out all manner of ſlaviſh fear. I could never love heartily, where I could fear really: where love is turned into fear, equity changed into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſociety into obedience, there can never be a perfect friendſhip: here is too much care for kindneſs, inequality for amity, obedience for
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:179860:76"/> love, and ſpeaks my friend more a maſter than a fociable companion. Certainly I could never comply here without flattery and vexation, there being a flavery in fear too baſe for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>Eightly, never detract from the credit of your friend, but ſtill acknowledge his juſt deſerts; as it is flattery to raiſe his value beyond his juſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſo it is injuſtice to diminiſh his real worth, never believe his praiſe-worthy qualities your diſparagement; if you do, you are not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt but envious. I would rejoice as much in the commendation of my friend as my own, beeauſe I can with freedom expreſſe my ſatisfaction in the applauſe of my friend, and augment it; when I ſhould think it more diſcreet and civil by a bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilence to receive the ſame for my ſelf: I do oftner contemplate the goodneſs of my friend then his errours, becauſe I love pleaſure, and fear perplexity: I hate to be like the ungrateful raven, that flyes nimbly over many pleaſant things, and pitches with delight on a carcaſſe. I would rather convince my friend by a contrary example and behaviour than be too officious in ſearching into his defects, that may be he is as far from juſtifying, as I am from commending, and he needs no reproof being too ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn himſelf, and yet at preſent cannot aſſume the title of conqueror; we cannot think we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract alliance with angels: in our beſt frendſhips mnny a ſlip muſt be winkt at, and a friend may challenge ſo much as this, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ſhould uſe all poſſible means to keep up the credit of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:179860:77"/> him, to whom we are ſo nearly related: nor can we be kind or juſt, if we do not improve all to his advantage in this regard.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, never manage any diſpute with paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this will intangle the web of frendſhip, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the peace, and turn your harmony unto jangling: diſputes are ſeparating things, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> lived friendly together, till diſpute parted them, pride very often is at the bottom of diſputes, and will contend for victory, and men will venture very hard for it: witneſs thoſe ſad diſſentions in the Church of God at this day. I would rather conſult my books, and learned au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, or rational ſtrangers, or any indifferent perſon then with my friend about matters of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, becauſe I would not run the venture of contention; friends may deliberately argue, and convince one another, and this may augment their profit, and experience, but they muſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a diſpute, wherein there is a forcible op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made on both ſides; it will be more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to leave it to them that are better able to manage it, or to a more eonvenient ſeaſon. I have obſerved that thoſe that have ſeemed unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadable while the diſpute continued, afterwards upon a more mature conſideration by the ſame arguments have been convinced; and was not this ſilent and peaceable victory better than that which might have ended in a quarrel, men are not willing to ſubmit their reaſon, where they think they ſhall paſſe under any ſlight or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value, yet upon mature conſideration and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid contemplation afterwards, it appearing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:179860:77"/> reaſon will force them to ſubmit, which they are willing to do when it may be done ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and without noiſe.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, be not curiouſly inquiſitive after any thing you find an averſeneſs in your friend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, and do not believe it a breach of frendſhip, if upon ſuch an attempt he denies you: it may be your humour and preſent capacity cannot bear it, or the ſeaſon is not fit for it; or ſhould he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify your curioſity, he may be cruel in what you call kindneſs, confide ſo much in your friend, as to believe that he will conceal nothing from you, that will do you good to know, and what he doth in this particular is from prudence not perverſneſs. Inſtance in this one particular; I have committed a fault and have perhaps ingaged my reaſon and conſcience againſt me, and is not that enough, but I muſt engage my friend againſt me alſo. I ambition nothing more, (next to my intereſt in God and eternal concernments) then the good opinion of my friend, and ſhall I not preſerve it by all means poſſible? I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver betray my ſelf to his cenſure: I had rather paſs under his approbation, than condemnation: the firſt will confirm the frendſhip, the laſt will looſen it: I never thought it civil to preſſe my friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a voluntarie complianee, nor paſſionately to ſcrue a ſecret out of him: this were to betray my truſt and rob his cabinet becauſe he hath truſted his key with me, which he did not do to hazard his own intereſt, but to ſecure mine. It is true a friend muſt be truſted with ſecrets, yet it doth not follow that he muſt be entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:179860:78"/> with all ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rets. Inſtance, there are many things that I can neither in prudence, nor conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, that may be againſt the truſt impoſed in me, which though from an enemy, I muſt be faithful, &amp; no obligation poſſible can releaf me: this may be what I cannot diſcloſe without betraying my ſelf into thoſe inconveniences, that nothing in frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can repair, <hi>Sampſon</hi> had a ſecret the diſcloſing of which proved his ruine. No man but hath ſomething that is moſt proper for himſelf to know and no other: and I ſhould think it the greateſt bondage to be reſtrained here imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, my friend is not my confeſſor, nor a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge in every caſe, he is a traytor and no friend, that would induce me (as <hi>Dalila</hi> did <hi>Sampſon</hi>) to betray my ſelf in any thing ſorbidden by conſcience and prudence. Theſe things muſt be left to the wiſdom of your friend, who is not worthy of that relation, if he cannot manage this affair without prejudice to himſelf or his friend. Nor could I with reaſon conclude that man could keep my ſecrets that could not keep his own, or be faithful to me that betrayed himſelf.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, never indent nor impoſe on your friend after the friendſhip is made; that were to make propoſitions after the truce is concluded, which is very irregular, you had your liberty in your firſt choice: you might have made what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions you pleaſed: and if inequallity had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared have deſerted him without cenſure or prejudice, but now it is too late: by ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour you extreamlie diſoblige your friend, becauſe you preſuppoſe him unfit for that relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:179860:78"/> without manacles and bolts, and this ſpeaks, him a priſoner, where he ought to have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt freedom; and plainly delares you ſelfiſh, wholly aiming at your own ſatisfaction, little regarding that of your fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end; beſides you expoſe your judgement to cenſure by fixing, before you were in all points thorowly reſolved, in all things relating to this great concernment. Likewiſe you make your ſelf a judge of the qualifications pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for friendſhip, excluding your friend as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a novice in this point. Laſtly you plainly tell him, he is obliged, and you are not: he ſtands upon his good behaviour, and you at your liberty: thus you article with him: by all which you declare, you are unfixed till he anſwers all thoſe articles, and that he muſt ſtand and fall by your judgment. I love liberty as well as any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet would expect no more here than I would give: I would never ask of my friend what was ſlaviſh or unhandſom, or prejudicial to him, or any thing that may ſpeak me mercenary or uncivil; nor would I grant it if he deſired it of me, I may conceal my errors, but never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, nor communicate them, they do not deſerve an intereſt in a vertuous perſon that doth ſo.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, Never contend for ſuperority, ſince friendſhip hath made you equal; It is more prudence to ſhrink than ſtretch here; ſuch quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels that ariſe about place and ſuperiority, are mechanick and baſe, and they that leaſt deſerves it moſtly contends for it. I would abate in this caſe rather than contend, yet ſhould I be no lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:179860:79"/> for what I loſt one way I ſhould gain ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if humility be better then pride;) I would not grudge my place, where I could give my heart, nor fear any cenſure, becauſe thereby I do not give away my right, or make him more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferving that takes it, but I lay this obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my friend that <hi>I</hi> can deny my ſelf any thing, him nothing.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, In all differences between your friend and others endeavour to be abſent (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,) if you cannot, be ſure you be ſilent: by intermedling there you can do no good: if you ſpeak for him you will be thought to be partial, if you be never ſo juſt; if you ſpeak againſt him you can neither be friendly nor civil: and theſe two inconveniences will neceſſarily follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the ſtrengthning your friends enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and weakning your intereſt in your friend, beſide his diſappointment is ſo much the greater having this aggravation entailed upon it, that whereas your friend had but one to contend with before, (and that enemy, which he did not care were he ſatisfied or not) he hath now a friend alſo to perſwade, leſt he ſhould by any means eſpouſe the quarrel: it being not ſeldom the endeavour of an enemy ſo to widen the difference as they may take in our beſt friends: I do not wonder that I ſee wiſe men ſometimes to ſeek to finde arguments to plead their innocency, when ſuch croſſe accidents as theſe fall out, in which men are ſurprized. It is probable a man may be provided with arguments enough for his adverſary; but theſe may be too harſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:179860:79"/> for his friend, which he deſires to treat with more moderation than the other may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but now he is at a loſſe; for while he is making good his atgument with the one, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it with the other, becauſe he may be urged to paſſion by his enemy, but bound to patience with his friend; and while he exerciſes patience to him, paſſion out-runs him in his adverſary, which may very well be becauſe he hath two parts to act, the adverſary but one; he hath not only paſſion to contend with againſt his enemy, but moderation to exerciſe towards his friend, therefore cannot keep equal pace with his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; ſo his task is doubled. This is the reaſon men are argued many times of their right: paſſion is quicker-witted than patience in all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty matters, and will not ſtay till patience can deliberately deliver it ſelf: paſſion is more ready with accuſations, than patience can be with vindications, there being much more of the uſe of reaſon in the laſt than in the firſt. Commonly men are generall in their aſperſions, which when they come to be divided and anſwered to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, requires much reaſon in order to the right arguing of them. I would never truſt that man that ſhould joyn in a quarrel, or be a voluntary evidence againſt his friend, this were a crime that could not be palliated by any pretence whatſoever. There are but two things I ever ſaw offered by way of defence in this caſe, neither of which can excuſe it: It may be (you will ſay) your friend contended with his ſuperiour, and did not obſerve his diſtance,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:179860:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> and you thought that you ſhould have been no leſſe uncivil if you had not at leaſt ſhewed your diſſent by way of reproof, <hi>I</hi> never ſaw ſuch civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſeaſonable or grateful to either; for the firſt he thinks he deſerves it, and therefore will own it not courteſie, the other will believe it a breach of friendſhip, which ought to be conſidered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore complements: this ſeems to be allowable only in parents, who ſometimes in quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their children, may condemn the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent either out of complement to a father who may be honoured for his title, or by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to affrighten h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m from contention where he may be overmatched to his damage; there is no ſuch obligation in friendſhip, parents walk in a path of unſearchable liberty in this regard, and may diſpence with the rules of exact juſtice, there being none capabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of queſtioning them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their power and propriety which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream; but friends are under reſtrictions &amp; tyed up to laws that are indiſpenſable; But (may be) you will ſay in the ſecond place, your friend did not ſtate the caſe right, and therefore you could not underſtand his innocencie: if ſo, you had the leaſt reaſon to cenſure him: if your friend had not been readie with his arguments, you had the more reaſon to help him, or at leaſt have been ſilent till you could have been better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: you know prejudice is a dangerous drugg, and like a pill eaſily ſwallowed, but like poyſon hardly purged out by the beſt arguments; nor will he that hath done the injury ſtay to cure a wound he hath deſigninglie made, but like a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:179860:80"/> ſecretly ſtrikes a trecherous blow, and runs away, being afraid to contend where he is ſure to be vanquiſhed: I could never take him to be my friend that could eaſily be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me.</p>
            <p>To avoid this and many inconveniences more, Never ambition to be with your frend in all companyes, nor dive into his tranſactions with all perſons without his conſent: this is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon him, and entrench upon his freedom, which cannot be acceptable: men will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be abridged of their liberty; nor can it be always civil either with reſpect to your friend or thoſe he converſes with: no man but hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he in prudence ought to manage himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without the preſence of the deareſt friend. I would aſmuch deſire to diſcourſe my buſines with a ſtranger alone ſometimes, as at other times to enjoy my own thoughts without any interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and it is as neceſſary: it is poſſible the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with whom I converſe ſometimes, cannot have that freedom to diſcourſe matters of weight before a ſtranger, who though he be never ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, cannot be fit to be truſted with their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, without juſt ſuſpicion and exception. I never thought it any breach of frendſhip to forbid the frequent opening of my letters by my beſt friend, believing it reaſonable to preſerve that priviledge to my ſelf; I never remember I ever made a quarrel with any friend about that, but certainly I have often ſignifyed my diſpleaſure at it. I conceive by the ſame rule, that all truths are not to be ſpoken at all times: ſo letters may
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:179860:81"/> not be broken at all times, beeauſe hereby I am not only liable to prejudice my ſelf, but all thoſe that entruſt me; and I muſt deal faithfully with every man as well as with my friend. It is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>I</hi> may be truſted with thoſe affairs for ſome perſon that will think it as much againſt his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt as his inclination, to have them revealed to any, but what he had deſigned and prepared. My friend though he be bound to me, is not bound to all that converſe with me, neither is he conſtrained by any manner of tye to fancy all that I fancy, or to make a quarrel with every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I cannot like; <hi>I</hi> confeſs <hi>I</hi> would not give that ground for ſuſpicion to hold an intercourſe by letters or otherwiſe, without his knowledge and approbation; yet in buſineſſes that more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie concern my ſelf, if they muſt be known (eſpeciallie in thoſe things, wherein there may be ſcruples,) <hi>I</hi> would willinglie be the relater my ſelf; and this may be neceſſarie ſometimes becauſe buſineſs may be uncertainlie underſtood, or by the unfaithfulnefs of the relater ſo falſlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, that it may admit of ſuch interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as might much prejudice credit, and queſtion conſcience; not becauſe there is any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, but the ignorance or malice of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former. <hi>I</hi> have known little pettie diſcontents in letters, not handſomelie worded, made mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of contempt and ſcandal, whereas if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had been preſent that underſtood the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, he might have given ſuch ſolid ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that might have anſwered all the cavils and exceptions with much eaſe, and obtained a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:179860:81"/> vindication. <hi>I</hi> would never impoſe upon my friend, but would willingly abſent my ſelf at any time (if <hi>I</hi> ſaw it neceſſary) but moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch ſeaſons as theſe are; Inſtance when he is to converſe with his near relations private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: there are many reaſons to be given why a dear friend and neareſt relations ſhould not alwaies be pleaſant one to another. The perſons concerned may through Jealouſie be ungrateful, and a friend can hardlie carrie it ſo, as to give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual content in that caſe, or at leaſt would not willingly be at that trouble; neither would <hi>I</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be preſent when weightie buſineſſes that did no way concern me, were tranſacting between my friend and ſtrangers: above all, <hi>I</hi> would withdraw my ſelf, when <hi>I</hi> ſaw him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſlie inclined about matters of eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and <hi>I</hi> would give him all the help poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there; and hereby <hi>I</hi> ſhould wonderfullie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my real and intire affection, alſo my own advantage would incline me to encourage him rather than divert him; being ſure of this, that his advantage will be my gain, becauſe he would certainly intereſt me in his prayers, and I ſhould partake of the benefits of his contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this may ſometimes be ſo ſeaſonable, that I would not be without it for all the world. I have ſeen private contemplations and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, through the bleſſing of God ſo improved, as to prove more effectual for the reſolving of ſome puzling ſcruples coming from a particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, than the advice of ſeveral Divines; and this comes to paſſe, becauſe experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:179860:82"/> hath more credit, than that which is doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: the one may floate in the head, the other ſinks into the heart; and makes the face of a man to ſhine, like <hi>Moſes</hi> conſpicuouſly in his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſation.</p>

         <div n="152-172" type="pages">
            <p>Fourteenthly, give ſound and ſerious advice to your friend without obliging him to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, leave him to his libetty, why ſhould not his judgment be as good as yours? draw your argument as fair as you can, it is no harm to arm at ſucceſſe, but do not contend for it, nor be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, if your counſel be neglected; adviſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

               </gap> empire: this is not the way to be honoured with victory to make your ſelf a judge, If you give advice and exact obedience, you rather act like an ambitious man, than a kind and ingenious friend. Counſel is moſt taking, when propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with humility and indifferency. I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my friend to any thing, when I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to nothing: arguments they are ſometimes like food, that in the firſt taſt cannot be relliſhed, but afterwards is very delicious and pleaſant to the pallat; or like ſome ſpirits, that are very unpleaſant to the palate, but of great benefit after concoction to the ſtomach. I would leave my counſel as my books to be well ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before I would expect either a complyance to the one, or an approbation to the other: and at laſt would not think the worſe of my friend if he liked neither.</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly, Never harbour any ſuſpition of your friend; be well adviſed here: you cannot act more diſpleaſing than in entertaining cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:179860:82"/> ſuſpition, becauſe hereby you may wrong him, and impeach him when he is moſt innocent: and what is more thornie and wounding then cauſeleſs ſuſpition, it creates jealouſie and mistruſt of that perſon who intends moſt unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly; I would never make frendſhip where I could not confide without ſuſpition; becauſe if I can't be confident of his ſincerity, I cannot believe nor truſt him, nor count him honeſt, nor pay him that civility that frendſhip requires, If you have any temptation to this, argue it gravely and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly: may be the defect is in the eye, not in the object: when we conſider the various acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of everie day, in which no man is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed or diſpleaſed with the ſame things, we may ſuſpect our ſelves. Melancholy is verie ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, and in that dark ſtate we ſtumble at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſtraw: and becauſe my own diſtemper hath caſt ſtumbling blocks in my way, ſhall I ſuſpect my friend of treacherie, and unfaithfulneſs, or want of real affection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſay, becauſe I cannot always diſcern his ſincerity, (when hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily I am blinded with prejudice, paſſion, or diſcontent, ſurely there is no ſuch thing:) O this were moſt unreaſonable: we may as well ſay, that half of the oare is broken, becauſe out of our ſight and in the water: and a blind man may as truly conclude, there is no ſun in the heavens, becauſe he cannot ſee it: or we may diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the being of the ſun, becauſe it is under a cloud, or in an ecclipſe.</p>
            <p>Sixteenthly, Never think a new friend better than an old; many things are moſt valuable for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:179860:83"/> their age: frendſhip is one of theſe; an old friend like old wine is much better then new; It gathers ſpirits, as it expends days: without queſtion friendſhip grows more vigorous and active by the delightful intercourſe, and thoſe endearments it feeds upon. Frendſhip is not ſo perfect in its infancy, as in its riper years: it augments as thoſe worthy qualities it firſt pitched upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, and are more ſplendid: the hidden parts of frendſhip are not ſeen all at once, nor can be: they diſcover themſelves according to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and times they are moſt welcome and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in: a friend acts many parts which require time and order: if you eſteem your friend wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, he will appear much better by tryal, and experience, whereby you will be ſatisfied of his habitual worthineſs; he was new, you have kept him till he is old: ſay not now the new is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I could never fancy any earthly thing in hope equal much leſs beyond that in hand; or expect happineſs in the change of what I was in a good meaſure ſatisfied in before; that proverb is not contemptible, ſeldom comes a better. I could never neglect and deſpiſe any whom I once thought worthy of my affection: nor think it prudence to part wirh my cabinet, in which my chief treaſure lies, becauſe the varniſh is worn off, &amp; it is not ſo handſome as when it was new, I mean my ſecrets, which are my moſt precious jewels. One friend according to this meaſure is enough for my whole life, if death doth not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, nothing elſe ſhall by my occaſion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. I cannot change but at a great uncertainty,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:179860:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> for if I could not find reaſon to continue the old frendſhip, I ſhould find leſs to make another. It muſt be ſome errour in the firſt that induces me to make a ſecond, and that muſt be what I did not at firſt diſcover, and therefore cannot be certain, I ſhall not find the ſame defect in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe men act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as their age and temper of body inclines them, and that may be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent at one time, to what it is at another. We cannot expect that pleaſure in age, we found in youth, nor that content in ſickneſs we found in health; all theſe things muſt be conſidered and allowed: If you have found a faithful friend, you have found a treaſure, &amp; admit he may not be in all points what you would have him to be, he is too good to part with, &amp; moſt likely your gain in the change will never recompenſe your loſſe, nor can you ever rationally think to gain credit with a new friend, when you have loſt it with the old, he may flatter you, but he will never truſt you: he may humour you, but can never honour you, nor hartily cloſe with you, having great grounds for ſuſpition, and fear of a heart breaking ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Seventeenthly, Be free and generous: <hi>A gift</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man) <hi>faſteneth friendſhip:</hi> give bountifully and receive thankfully, the ſmalleſt kindneſs: think nothing too good or too great for your friend: nor eſteem that a recompence fit for kindneſs received, except you can equal or exceed it; better ſtill lie under an obligation than make a half ſatisfaction: nothing ſhort is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted any thing in this caſe: it may underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:179860:84"/> the gift, but never gratify the giver. I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take a ſmall gift kindely from my friend, becauſe it makes me no great debtor, and ſpeaks his love as truly as a greater, yet I would not give meanly, were I obliged and able to do better; and it is no crime in me to endeavour to outdo my friend in noble and generous actions: this ſeems a paradox becauſe we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how we ſpeak properly when we ſpeak of giving or receiving among friends, where hearts are united and conſequently they can have no divided intereſt, but all things are common; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we mean by it the ſignification of the thing which is more then the thing it ſelf, as a reall and ſincere affection: I would not value any courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or civility that did not bring more of affection than profit: I can eaſily compenſate the laſt and diſcharge my ſelf, but muſt lie under an eternal obligation for the other.</p>
            <p>Eighteenthly, Never diſſemble with your friend, but deal plainly with him, eſpecially when he referrs himſelf to you: do not call bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſweet, and ſweet bitter: this is the worſe way of ingratiating your ſelf, and by this means you may prove a traytor to him if you can keep off evil, do it with all poſſible care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but when you ſee it will come unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, rather prepare him for it, than keep it from him: nothing more cruel than diſappointment; which no man oftner finds then he that is flattered into a belief of what is really impoſſible. It is as great a wrong to a man, to heap upon him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritted commendations, as to detract from his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:179860:84"/> juſt deſerts. I would not be the firſt that would impeach my friend, nor the laſt that would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive him, iſ I ſaw him inclinable to overvalue himſelf.</p>
            <p>Nineteenthly, Let your ſpeech and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be religious, ſolid and civil, it is <hi>Pauls</hi> advice, that <hi>we be courteous;</hi> there is much in this to promote content: words may be healing, and they may be wounding. <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved, that <hi>they are like honey. David</hi> obſerves, <hi>they are like arrows,</hi> that ſhoots fwiſtly, ſecretly, and deadly, ſaith he, <hi>they ſhoot arrows againſt me,</hi> even bitter words: in order hereunto, ſhun all unfaithful repetitions. I mean by this, ſuch as for matter repreſents things abſolutely contrary to the meaning of them that ſpeak. It is uſual with us to wreſt words according to our own fancies: good meanings may be often ſo ill-worded, that they may prove matter of reproach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſcorn; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially becauſe often ſeconded by ſmart and cruel reflexions: acceptable words are very pleaſant; ſuch as theſe <hi>Paul</hi> refers to, when he ſays, <hi>let your words be ſeaſoned with ſalt, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring grace to the hearers:</hi> ſuch words as theſe leave a kinde of titillation and pleaſure upon the heart, which ſweetneſs abſence, and reconciles all croſſe accidents that are preſent whereas on the other ſide contrariwiſe evil words leave a diſrelliſh upon the heart, and extreamly imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and aggravates ſuch accidents: Evil words are the ground of all quarrels; it is exceeding neceſſary, as well as pleaſing, that there be a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of good words among friends, becauſe the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:179860:85"/> tongue is not ſeldom like an unruly and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant, that very often runs without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his maſter, and is not ſeldom prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by paſſion; we think it a ſufficient excuſe, when the injury is done, to ſay, I was raſh, and ſpake what I did not believe or think; This is breaking my head and giving a plaiſter, and very ſeldom ſignifyes any thing in reference to a reconciliation: beſides paſſion doth not ſtudy privacy, and if a ſcandalous word reaches the ear of a third perſon, it may prove like a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, that will admit of no cure, and ſurely provides work for the Devil and his imps, who would rejoice in ſuch an opportunity, that they might aggravate things to a final ſeparation. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> gives us a hint of this, and ſaith, <hi>a talebearer ſeparates chief friends;</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>ſuch a tongue is ſet on fire of hell:</hi> therefore we had need have the more care, and conclude all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with this exhortation of S. <hi>Paul, Let all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, wrath, anger, clamour, evil ſpeaking, be put away from you, and be kinde one to another, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted, forgiving one another, as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> Again, never paſſe ſentence againſt your friend, or willingly be judge in any caſe that concerns him, eſpecially if the matter be hidden and intricate, or if you finde in your heart the leaſt partiality; otherwiſe you wrong your ſelf and your friend; both your ſelf in indulging a paſſion, your friend in condemning the truth, or at leaſt injuring of it; which muſt needs ſuffer where partiality is concerned. If you muſt judge becauſe your friend will have it
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:179860:85"/> ſo, let him not loſe his end, who expects from you juſtice mixed with clemency and charity, and be as willing to clear as to condemn, if no cauſe very criminal appears.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, baniſh all things that may alienate your heart from your friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Entertain him kindly, let him have a ſeat in your heart: think of him with delight; love his company: bear with him, though he appear ſometimes not ſo amiable; commend him when he doth well; excuſe him when he is in fault: caſt the mantel of love upon his infirmities: win him rather by love then fear: ſtudy his humour: think it not beneath you to comply, though little reaſon induces you to it at that inſtance: contemplate all his vertues and imitate them: decline his errors, and by a contrary example convinee him: live together: love &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice together: comunicate your vertues, improve your ſociety to a mutual advantage: he only is fit for frendſhip that can do all thoſe offices for which frendſhip is excellent; treat your friend handſomly and nobly, multiply thoſe endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon him that ſhall make him your own inſeparably; improve ſociety by frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; nothing in this relation more endearing than repeated fruition; and in this reſpect frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſurpaſſes all other relations becauſe it is without diſguſt: ſtudy what friends you would have upon the exacteſt election, and be that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is much: frendſhip is not for contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſhew, but for material comfort and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſatisfaction, and is advantageous to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual as well as rational parts, when religion and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:179860:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> reaſon go hand in hand the frendſhip is moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious becauſe ſingularly advanc't hereby. I come now to the Laſt thing promiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion by way of commendation; here ſee the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration and confirmation of the happineſs, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and excellency of the capacity and ſtate of frendſhip.</p>
            <p>In order hereunto give me leave to ſet before you the beſt and higheſt example poſſibly in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth: the man Chriſt Jeſus, who may if we conſult reaſon and Scripture be verily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to contract a frendſhip with <hi>John</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt.</hi> We do not find that our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord took any delight in ſenſuall pleaſures upon earth: yet it is more than probable, he had pleaſure in this rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal recreation of a moral friendſhip: which may eaſily reach our belief if we examine his own books, the holy Scriptures that teſtifie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of him, if the cauſe may be concluded by the effect, the thing by its properties, then it will not be hard to prove, that there was a moral friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and <hi>John,</hi> and that which ſeems to ſtrengthen the argument may be this: if friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be the improvement of the rational part, as it hath been already proved; then it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be in our ſaviour, who improved both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals and ſpirituals to the higheſt perfections imaginable; nor is this any paradox, that Chriſt ſhould improve in his naturals; for it is undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he was a child and in minority before he came to riper years: and it cannot be thought that our Saviour had as much perfection in his reaſon when he was wrapped in his ſwadling
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:179860:86"/> hands in the Inn, as he had when he was thirty years of age, teaching in the temple; without queſtion he improved in his reaſon as he multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed years, and had a more imperfect uſe of his reaſon in his youth than after he came to be a grown man: nor can it be abſurd to believe our Saviour having ſo ſweet a nature was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſociable pleaſure, as a diverſion for the repair of his humane nature, which was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten afflicted, vexed and grieved: and that his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature needed repairs, may be concluded by his eating, drinking, and ſleeping, <hi>John.</hi> 4. 6. it is ſaid, <hi>Jeſus being wearied, ſat down upon the well:</hi> othertimes <hi>he withdrew from the multitude, and conveyed himſelf from them, when they preſſed upon him:</hi> and no diverfion ſo innocent, and had ſo litle temptation, as this of friendſhip. There are theſe ſeven arguments following, that ſeems to prove this, and they are all eminent properties of a moral friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the denomination given to <hi>John;</hi> that <hi>he was the diſciple whom Jeſus loved:</hi> we finde <hi>John</hi> among the diſciples rarely known by any other name, and this plainly diſcovers the love that our Saviour had to the perſon of <hi>Iohn</hi> in a moral ſenſe, and this is moſt evident, becauſe it came within the obſervation of the reſt of the diſciples; for had it been Chriſts love to the ſoul of <hi>Iohn</hi> that was intended by that appellation, that had been inward and ſpiritual, and could not have been underſtood by them; and we do not finde our Saviour by any declaration demonſtrate any ſuch thing; ſo that nothing can rationally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:179860:87"/> here, but that the diſciples did gather this love of Chriſt to <hi>John</hi> from ſome outward and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible cauſe, as his friendly diſcourſe and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards <hi>Iohn,</hi> as alſo the intimacy that was obſerved between them; as lying in his boſome and conſtant communion, and his indulgence; all which we ſhall conſider more particularly in the following arguments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the familiar converſe between our Lord and <hi>Iohn</hi> is another propertie, and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares friendſhip: <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to lye in the boſome of Chriſt, and this ſeems to import much intimacy, and much affection: we dearly love them we take into our boſomes; yet this is but an outward expreſſion, and therefore may be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral frendſhip, and the rather becauſe theſe imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are the proper acts of a moral friendſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as the former denomination did expreſſe our Saviours tranſcendent kindneſſe to <hi>Iohn</hi> beyond the other diſciples, ſo this doth no leſſe ſpeak the intimacy, that was between them beyond what was enjoyed by the reſt of the diſciples. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable <hi>Peter</hi> lay as near the heart of Chriſt as <hi>Iohn</hi> in a ſpiritual ſenſe, and many believers ſince; if we could not conclude our Saviours love to us but by ſuch expreſſions, we muſt be ſhut up under deſpair; nor could the diſciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have been without juſt cauſe of deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, doubtleſs that which did ſatisfy their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits was, they looked upon it only as an outward expreſſion of his love to <hi>Iohn,</hi> as alſo the delight he had in his perſon, happily for ſome obliging qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity our Saviour ſaw in him, more than in the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:179860:87"/> reſt; and this made them rather incline to honour, than envy <hi>Iohn</hi> who unqueſtionably was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honourable and happy in this relation of friendſhip, wherein he ſtood towards our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: And this may be the better credited if we conſider that it is not uſual with men to be unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with one another touching their elections of friendſhip, nor think themſelves diſobliged that they are paſſed by and others pitched upon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they allow a freedom to every man in that caſe according as his fancy and affection leads him.</p>
            <p>The third Argument is drawn from the intereſt <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeemed to have in our Saviour above the reſt of his Diſciples, as appears in that caſe of <hi>Iudas, Iohn</hi> 13. 26. and when our Saviour ſignified <hi>that one ſhould betray him,</hi> they were all amazed, ſaying, <hi>is it I? is it I? Mark.</hi> 14. 19. and none preſumed to ask our Saviour a reſolution in this doubtful caſe: ſuch was the diſtance between our Lord and them; but this diſtance was not between <hi>Iohn</hi> and him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Diſciples no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner applyed themſelves to <hi>Iohn</hi> to move our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior in the caſe, but the queſtion was immediatly anſwered: nor do we finde that <hi>Iohn</hi> uſed the leaſt ceremony in his addreſſes to our Lord, but with as much freedom as poſſible asked the queſtion of our Saviour; who readily anſwered, with as much ſatisfaction; and this is a notable property of friendſhip; becauſe this act carries in it the greateſt intimacy &amp; propriety, both which muſt needs make up a full and perfect frendſhip, including every thing that can make that capacity happy.</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:179860:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Fourthly, It is very probable, <hi>Iohn</hi> had more of the ſecrets of Chriſt than the reſt; and this is no ſmall property of frendſhip; the communion that paſſed between our Saviour and <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in the Mount, was a ſecret many of the diſciples knew nothing of, yet it was not peculiar to <hi>Iohn;</hi> for <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> was there alſo: <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 2. by which it appears Chriſt had peculiar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which he contributed as he pleaſed, &amp; I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conceive that perſon who was moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beloved, was not without peculiar diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, at leaſt of thoſe things which concerned his perſon: it's probable <hi>Iohn</hi> knew more of our Saviours prudential proceedings, and moral tranſactions then the reſt did. I conclude it from hence, becauſe though the reſt of the diſciples were ignorant of this treachery of <hi>Iudas,</hi> it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like <hi>Iohn</hi> was not; if ſo, he would not have needed an incitement to be reſolved who ſhould betray our Saviour, having the advantage of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo near him as in his boſom; we may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conjecture he would have readily asked that queſtion, and we may as rationally conceive, that our Saviour had not only diſcovered this ſad and perplexing providence publickly to all his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but privately to <hi>Iohn</hi> the beloved diſciple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there is the more credit to be given to this ſuppoſition, becauſe we know that there can be no frendſhip where there is not a communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of affairs; and we find our Saviour did often diſcourſe of his death to all his diſciples, and therefore moſt likely to <hi>Iohn</hi> the beloved diſciple and friend of Chriſt: friends delighting as much
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:179860:88"/> ſometimes to diſcourſe their afflictions; as other times to diſcourſe their affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it appears by what hath been already obſerved, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had a friend, ſo I conceive we may without prejudice conclude, he did not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny the uſe and benefit of him, as to ſocial ſatisfaction, ſervice, content, and pleaſure; yet notwithſtanding from all this, or any thing elſe, we connot conclude <hi>Iohn</hi> had more knowledg in ſpiritual things than the other diſciples, who (we know) were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of many truths and ſome fundamentals; for they dreamed of an earthly kingdom, that our Saviour ſhould have here on earth: and it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his reſurrection before they were informed of many things touching him; and then our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſent his ſpirit that taught them all things: It is probable <hi>Iohn</hi> was no more inſtructed; than the reſt before, becauſe if any of the diſciples had underſtood thoſe things, it is likely none would have been ignorant; for we ſee they were willing to inform each other by the diſcourſes that paſſed between them at the ſepulchre, &amp; in their travail to <hi>Emaus</hi> about our Saviours death and reſurrection; nor do we ever finde that the diſciples did ever addreſſe themſelves to <hi>Iohn</hi> to be informed of any of Chriſts miracles, or any hidden and divine thing; yet we know they often heſitated about ſuch things, and reaſoned among themſelves concerning them, ſo that the conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is pretty clear, that the outward acts of Chriſts prudential negotiations upon earth, as his travelling and healing and other outward acts may be better known to <hi>Iohn</hi> the beloved diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:179860:89"/> than any of the reſt,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, another argument of our Saviours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to <hi>Iohn</hi> may be drawn from his iudul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to <hi>Iohn.</hi> We never read that he rebuked <hi>Iohn,</hi> as he did <hi>Peter</hi> by any particular reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t ſeverely checks <hi>Peter</hi> and calls him devil, <hi>get thee behind me ſatan;</hi> No doubt but <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſubject to miſtakes, as well as <hi>Peter;</hi> for we find that <hi>Iohn</hi> was as drowſy as the reſt when Chriſt was in his paſſion, where it might have been expected he ſhould have been moſt watchful above any of the reſt of the diſciples; yet we do not find that our Saviour takes any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this ſo as to reprove <hi>Iohn</hi> more than the reſt, and it is probable Chriſt may uſe more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, becauſe of the relation, though his want of watchfulneſs in ſuch extremity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſeems a great fault in <hi>Iohn.</hi> A friend never inclines to grieve the heart of him he dearly loves, becauſe the greater kindneſs the more wounding is any thing that looks like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; our Saviour was tender towards <hi>Iohn,</hi> who happily could not have born a reproof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much heart breaking trouble, becauſe of his tranſcendent affection to his Lord. No perſon more conſiderate than our Lord, who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion it ſelf; the man Chriſt Jeſus was a man of bowels, as we perceive by his lamenting over <hi>Ieruſalem, Luk</hi> 19. 42, 48. yet we find that our Saviour was more compaſſionate to ſome, than others, according as his affections was ſet. The Jews obſerved he wept for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he was dead, and why ſo? becauſe he loved him, as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:179860:89"/> appears by that paſſage in <hi>Iohn 11. 3. Lord, him whom thou loveſt is ſick,</hi> and we ſee by that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the young man in the Goſpel, that our Saviour could love a man for any worthy quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or moral aceommodation; the text ſaith, <hi>he looked upon him and loved him;</hi> not that he ſaw his own image upon his heart, (for this he had not, as is evident, becauſe he parted with our Saviour) but ſaw reaſon in his witty anſwers, which pleaſed our Saviour, ſo that he gave him an outward commendation ſuitable to his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall acquirements.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, the conſtant communion between our Saviour and <hi>Iohn</hi> is another argument to prove the frendſhip. <hi>Iohn</hi> was very rarely ſeparated from our Lord before his death and after his riſeing again while he was upon the earth. <hi>Peter</hi> took notice that this diſciple was following Chriſt after his ariſeing from the dead, and ſeems to be much concerned about him, how he ſhould be diſpoſed of, being to leave his dear Lord; and thereupon makes this queſtion to our Lord: <hi>Lord, what ſhall this man do?</hi> as iſ he had ſaid, our loſſe is great, but his much greater, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was; <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 22. our Saviours anſwer, ſeems to check <hi>Peters</hi> curioſity: <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of kindneſs between Chriſt and <hi>Iohn</hi> was not fit to be enquired into; as is evident by our Saviours more than tacite rebuke to <hi>Peter.</hi> It is moſt probable that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw our Saviour before any of the reſt aſter his reſurrection, becauſe he came with him, when our Lord appeared to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:179860:90"/> them, for <hi>Peter</hi> takes ſpecial notice, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 20. that he ſaw that diſciple following our Saviour; by which it is evident he was not among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is obſervable, that <hi>Iohn</hi> is ſeldom called by the diſciples or known by any other denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the other diſciple; or, the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom Jeſus loved. I conceive the diſciples might ſo ſrequently give him thoſe titles, either as titles of honour to ſignify the relation in which he ſtood to our Lord; or becauſe it pleaſed our Saviour, that his affections to <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hn</hi> ſhould be obſerved, and taken notice of; probably that a ſuitable reſpect might be given unto him, as the friend of Chriſt: for our Saviour was not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to own this relation, but publickly upon the croſſe ſignified it to men and angels, as will appear further in the ſeventh and laſt particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I ſubmit to better judgments in this matter; and only give my notion of it, and what ſeems moſt rational to me: but this is evident: our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and <hi>Iohn</hi> had much communion, they were ſtill together in his transfiguration, converſation, and communication: he never left our Saviour while on earth: you ſhall find him in the garden, and in the high-prieſts hall, where <hi>Peter</hi> denyed him in the one and deſerted him in the other: he was with him at the croſſe and at the ſepulchre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no wonder that our Saviour delighted in the ſociety of that perſon he would take into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; and <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſo improved by this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his Lord, that he ſpeaks and writes nothing but love, and this will appear a great confirmation of the frendſhip, if we compare it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:179860:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> with the frendſhips between ingenious men. Obferve and you ſhall find that when frendſhip is in reality, it mightily ſweetens the nature of thoſe perſons, ſo that they cannot endure harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and croſſneſs, but endeavour all things with all perſons by love. Men in their communication and converſation are as much as they are with whom they converſe. There are no arguments more pregnant to prove the dear and near com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and union between our Lord and <hi>Iohn,</hi> than the ſtrains of love that runs through all his writings, by which we may judge of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between our Lord and him; and what manner of expreſſions they were that paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in their particular acts of frendſhip.</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, the laſt argument may be drawn ſrom our Saviours laſt act of frendſhip towards <hi>Iohn,</hi> and were ſufficient, had there been no more to prove this frendſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his mother to <hi>Iohn,</hi> when he was upon the croſſe. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 26. 27. and breathing out his laſt breath expreſſed in this laſt paſſage; <hi>woman, behold thy ſon:</hi> and he ſaid to the diſciple whom he loved, <hi>Beheld thy mother,</hi> and from that hour that diſciple took her to his own home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you, ſee here the union that was between our Saviour and <hi>Iohn;</hi> they were brothers; though the relation of brothers preciſely conſidered do not make friends, yet the relation of frends al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways makes brothers; our Saviour by this charge to <hi>Iohn</hi> did imply thus much; that though his mother had loſt him, ſhe had a ſon ſtill, that was obliged to take a ſpecial care of her upon a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
